DISCHARGE DATE :
11-2-93
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Non-Q wave myocardial infarction .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Status post anterior myocardial infarction in 05-93 , status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of left anterior descending in 05-93 , hypertension , diabetes mellitus .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Coronary angiography , exercise tolerance test with Thallium .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Metoprolol 50 mg PO bid , Isordil 20 mg PO tid , enteric coated aspirin 1 PO qd .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 65 year old Portuguese male with a history of an anterior myocardial infarction i May 1993 and is status post a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the LAD who presented on 10-24-93 with crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath .
He had no prior cardiac history until May 1993 when on 5-24 he had crushing chest pain which radiated to his left arm .
He was found at that time to have 3-4 mm ST segment elevations in V1 through V4 at Pre Health .
The patient was transferred to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital and had 4-7 mm ST segment elevations across the precordium with Q's in V1 and V2 , 2 mm ST elevation in AVL , and 1-2 mm reciprocal ST depression in II , III , and F.
On physical examination at that time he had bright red blood per rectum and therefore lysis was deferred and he was taken directly to the cardiac catheterization lab .
The cardiac catheterization results at that time revealed a right atrial pressure of 7 , pulmonary artery pressure of 29/16 , RV 33/8 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 16 .
He had a 95% proximal left anterior descending lesion which was PTCA 'd to a residual of 30% and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed .
He also had some mild to moderate disease at the OM1 noted at that time .
The patient was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit where he had a peak CPK of 5,042 and 26.7% MB's .
His intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned without problems .
He had hypotension with beta blockers and therefore they were not started .
On day six , an echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 44% with anterior akinesis and septal hypokinesis .
On day nine , he had a low level exercise tolerance test with Thallium which was positive for 2.5 mm horizontal depressions in II , III , and AVF , and 1.5 mm downsloping ST depressions in V5 and V6 , as well as some anteroseptal redistribution on Thallium .
Therefore , he went to repeat cardiac catheterization which revealed that the left anterior descending site was patent and revealed a distal PDA lesion and a circumflex lesion after the OM .
The patient was discharged to home and is supposed to follow up with Dr. Shuffburle of Gastroenterology for work up of his bright red blood per rectum and is supposed to follow up with Dr. Amesin of Cardiology and Dr. Shuffpasc of Dingclearf Alllirefaith Memorial Hospital .
However , he did not keep any of these appointments .
He went home and did not take any of his medications and smoked and drank heavily throughout the several months .
On the a.m. of 10-24-93 , the patient developed crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath .
He came to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Emergency Ward where he was noted to be ashen and diaphoretic .
He was treated with oxygen , aspirin , five sublingual nitroglycerins , heparin , and was eventually made pain free with that regimen .
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS :
His cardiac risk factors included hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , cigarette smoking , and a positive family history .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
His past medical history included hypertension and non-insulin diabetes mellitus which is diet controlled .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
His past surgical history had included gastric ulcer surgery and appendectomy .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
On admission , he was on Isordil 10 tid and enteric coated aspirin , but he was not taking either of these medications .
HABITS :
The patient smokes one pack per day and has a history of heavy alcohol use .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The physical examination on admission revealed a blood pressure of 110/70 , a heart rate of 66 , respirations of 24 , temperature of 98 .
The HEENT exam revealed the extra ocular movements intact .
The pupils equal , round , reactive to light .
The oropharynx was clear and the fundi were normal .
There were no hypertensive or diabetic changes .
The neck was suppled , with no lymphadenopathy and no jugular venous distention .
The carotids were 1+ without bruits .
The heart was regular rate and rhythm , S4 , S1 , S2 , with a I / VI systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border .
The lungs were clear , except for a few dry crackles bibasilarly .
The abdomen revealed a midline scar and a right lower quadrant scar , and it was soft and nontender wit positive bowel sounds .
The liver edge was 2 cm below the right costal margin , but smooth and nontender .
There was no splenomegaly .
The femoral pulses were diminished .
He had bilateral intertrigo in his femoral region as well as his axillae .
The extremities revealed no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
The pulses were 1+ bilaterally .
The skin exam revealed changes consistent with vitiligo .
The rectal examination was guaiac negative .
LABORATORY DATA :
The laboratory data revealed normal electrolytes , BUN and creatinine , normal liver function tests , a first CPK of 140 , and a hematocrit of 43.1 .
The portable chest X-ray showed clear lungs , slight enlarged heart , and a mildly elevated hemidiaphragm .
The electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at 81 , with normal intervals and normal axis , had poor R-wave progression consistent with an old anterior myocardial infarction , had flipped T-waves in V1 through V5 , which were of no significant change since his last EKG on 5-25-93 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Step Down Unit for a rule out MI protocol .
He was treated with aspirin , heparin , and intravenous nitroglycerin .
No beta blockers was started because of his history of hypertension with beta blockers and because his blood pressure of only 110/70 .
The patient ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak CPK of 219 and 20.9% MB fraction .
This was a non-Q wave myocardial infarction as there were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes .
on 10-27-93 , the patient went to the cath lab which revealed a small nondominant right coronary artery without any lesions , a restenosis of the proximal left anterior descending lesion that had been PTCA 'd , a lesion in the first OM , and a moderately severe left circumflex lesion after the OM3 .
The left ventriculogram revealed an akinetic anterolateral and apical ventricle .
Given the results of this cardiac catheterization , which were not significantly changed from his previous cardiac catheterization prior to the PTCA , it was elected to attempt to medically manage the patient .
He was ambulated progressively on the floor .
A beta blocker was started with Metoprolol initially at 25 mg PO bid and eventually increased to 50 mg PO bid .
The patient ambulated extensively on the FIH 20 floor each day without any episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath .
On 11-2-93 , the patient underwent a low level treadmill exercise test with Thallium imaging .
This treadmill test was done on medications , including beta blockers , in hopes to assess an amount of ischemia on treatment .
The patient was able to exercise for approximately nine minutes on a modified Bruce protocol , however , he did not reach his predicted maximal heart rate while he was on the beta blockade .
There were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes during the treadmill exercise test , although he did have 0.5 to 1 mm ST depression in II , III , and AVF .
The study was halted for shortness of breath and there was no chest pain .
Thallium images revealed a moderate sized region of ischemic but viable myocardium involving the anteroseptal and lateral segments of the left ventricle .
There was also some evidence of left ventricular dysfunction during the test .
These images were essentially unchanged compared with the previous Thallium images in May 1993 .
After extensive discussion between myself , Dr. Amesin , and Dr. Scgach , it was elected to discharge the patient to home with medical management .
The patient was extremely reluctant to undergo surgery , although he understands that this may become necessary in the future .
Dr. Amesin had a long discussion with the patient 's daughters revolving primarily around issues of the patient 's compliance .
Previously he had not taken any of his medicines and smoked heavily on the outside and not kept any of his appointments .
The importance of quitting smoking as well as continuing to follow his medical regimen was emphasized to the daughter and to the patient .
She will be actively involved in encouraging the patient to comply with this medical regimen and also to follow up with Dr. Amesin as well as Dr. Lfsquarc on the outside .
The patient remained guaiac negative throughout the entire hospitalization .
Despite being on heparin for a short time , his hematocrit remained very stable with only a small dip after the catheterization was done .
He will need to be followed up as an out patient for guaiac positive stools and possibly worked up for this in the future .

He was taken to the Pre Health emergency room and at about 2:45 a.m. on 7/30 an electrocardiogram demonstrated 3 to 4 mm ST elevations in leads V1 to V4 and 2 mm ST elevations in lead V5 .
He was treated with nitroglycerin , antacids and intravenous morphine .
He was transferred to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital hemodynamically stable .
HE arrived in the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital emergency room with a blood pressure of 120/80 , heart rate 90 .
An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 94 with premature ventricular contractions .
It was notable for 4 to 7 mm ST elevations throughout the precordium with Qs in leads V1 and V2 , with 2 mm ST elevations in aVL and 1 to 2 mm reciprocal ST depressions in leads II , III and aVF .
The initial physical examination was notable for bright red blood per rectum .
He was treated with intravenous nitroglycerin , intravenous morphine , aspirin , Ativan and a LIdocaine drip .
Because of the noted bright red blood per rectum , thrombolysis was deferred and the patient was taken immediately to the cardiac catheterization laboratory .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Notable only for surgical repair of an ulcer and a remote appendectomy .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
None
ALLERGIES :
Penicillin , which gives him a rash .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
His habits include smoking one pack per day for many years and moderate to heavy alcohol use .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was an elderly appearing male in no significant distress .
His pulse was 84 and regular , blood pressure 114/70 .
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was unremarkable .
The neck was supple .
The carotids were of normal amplitude without bruits .
On cardiac examination he had a nonpalpable left ventricular impulse , a quiet S1 and S2 , no murmurs .
He had an audible S3 and a jugular venous pressure of 8 .
On lung examination he had rales one third up bilaterally .
His abdomen was soft and nontender with no hepatosplenomegaly , no guarding and no rebound .
On rectal examination he had bright red blood in the vault without any stool .
His extremities were without clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
LABORATORY DATA :
The hematocrit was 44.9 , white blood count 14.3 , platelet count 301,000 , sodium 138 , potassium 3.7 , chloride 102 , CO2 27.4 , BUN 12 , creatinine 1.0 , glucose 147 .
The electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 94 , left atrial enlargement , ST elevations in V4 through V6 , I and aVL , consistent with acute anterolateral myocardial infarction with Q waves in V1 to V3 and reciprocal ST depressions in leads II , III and aFV .
The chest X-ray showed a normal cardiac and mediastinal silhouette , mild pulmonary edema and an elevated left hemidiaphragm .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where hemodynamic measurements included a right atrial pressure of 7 , a right ventricular pressure of 33/8 , pulmonary artery pressure 29/16 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 16 .
He had a proximal 95% left anterior descending lesion and mild to moderate disease in the first obtuse marginal .
The left anterior descending lesion was angioplastied to a 30% residual stenosis .
An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed in the left groin prophylactically .
The patient was hemodynamically stable throughout and was transferred to the MICU .
On hospital day 2 the intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned .
The patient was intermittently agitated while on the intra-aortic balloon pump and was treated presumptively for alcohol withdrawal with Serax .
The Lidocaine drip was rapidly weaned as well .
On the third hospital day the intra-aortic balloon pump was removed .
The intravenous nitroglycerin and heparin were weaned off .
After removal of the intra-aortic balloon pump the patient was noticeably less agitated .
On the fourth hospital day an attempt was made to transfer the patient to the floor .
However , after a single dose of 25 mg of po metoprolol , the patient 's blood pressure dropped to the 60/40 range and he was therefore kept in the MICU .
The peak CPK level was on the second hospital day and was 5,042 with 26.7% MB fraction .
On the fifth hospital day the patient was considered stable for transfer to the floor .
Once on the floor the patient had no recurrent chest pain .
An echocardiogram was performed on the sixth hospital day which demonstrated an ejection fraction of 44% .
On transfer to the medical floor the patient was noted to have guaiac negative stool .
He was evaluated by the GI Service who felt that , given the patient 's course , he could undergo flexible sigmoidoscopy electively at some point in the future .
The patient underwent exercise stress testing with thallium on the ninth hospital day .
He exercised for 7 minutes and 30 seconds , achieving 80% of the maximal heart rate on the modified Bruce protocol .
He did not have chest pain .
There were ST and T wave abnormalities with 2.5 mm horizontal depressions at the beginning of 3 minutes of exercise , which persisted into recovery .
The thallium images showed fixed anterior and septal wall defects without any definite evidence of redistribution .
Based on this data , on the tenth hospital day the patient underwent repeat cardiac catheterization which demonstrated a patent left anterior descending site , a circumflex lesion after the third obtuse marginal , and a distal posterior descending artery lesion with a tight stenosis and a small vessel .
These findings were considered not to be hemodynamically significant and the patient was therefore to be discharged on medical therapy including nitrates and aspirin .
Because of his persistently marginal blood pressure at 100/70 , an ACE inhibitor which was tried briefly and a beta blockers were elected not to be continued .
The patient was discharged in stable condition on the eleventh hospital day .

She has had one pervious episode of variceal bleeding with an unclear date .
However she is followed by a Dr. Joasscchird at Vaila Medical Center .
She was in her usual state of health until one day prior to admission when she felt increasing fatigue , nausea and vomiting productive of bright red blood and coffee ground emesis .
She also had some black , tarry stool in her colostomy bag .
At Vaila Medical Center , she had a hematocrit of 25 and was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells .
She had an upper endoscopy at Va Sit Namar Healthcare showing an esophagus filled with clots and small amount of bleeding varices , clot in the stomach with antral gastritis , and a normal duodenum .

She was transfused another 2 units of packed red blood cells over the course of the day and her hematocrit improved to 29.4 and then 31.2 .
The GI service was consulted and an upper endoscopy study showed grade III varices with no active bleeding and a clean base gastric ulcer possibly secondary to the Blakemore tube .
Her varices had stigmata of recent bleeding , were banded successfully .
after the procedure and 2 more units of packed red blood cells , the patient was hemodynamically stable and hematocrit was stable at 31.2 .
At that time she was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to Coden 2 for the Lemgarson Hospital service .

158/60 with a heart rate of 85 , temperature 99.7 , respirations 14 .
Her neck showed no JVD .
Lungs clear to auscultation .
Her abdomen was obese and distended with good bowel sounds , large ventral hernia .
Colostomy with black stool .

She had no evidence of asterixis .
Her skin looked very bronze and tan , especially in the sun exposed areas .
She had no spider angiomata , no palmar erythema , no xanthomas and no caput medusae .
She did not look teric ( ??? ) .
LABORATORY DATA :
Notable for sodium 141 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 109 , bicarb 19.8 , BUN 38 , creatinine 1.2 and glucose 388 .
She had a pneumonia of 31 , calcium was 7.5 , phosphorous 3.0 , magnesium 1.3 .
Her bilirubin was 1.4 total , 0.2 direct .
alkaline phosphatase 101 .
SGPT 22 , SGOT 41 , amylase 31 , lipase less than 1 .
LDH was 38.9 , CK was 66 , her hematocrit was 27.4 , white count was 8.0 and her platelets were 55 .
PT was 14.5 , PTT 25.5 .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
As described above the patient was transfused an additional 2 units in the Intensive Care Unit and the patient also received an upper endoscopy study and her varices were banded .
On transfer to the Lemgarson Hospital service , her hematocrit was 31.2 , white count 11.1 and a platelet count 80 .
Her PT was 13.1 , PTT 26.7 .
The rest of her labs were unremarkable .
She was watched very closely while on the floor .
She was on GI bleed precautions at all times , was too large for IV .
She had a clot at the blood bank and she had BID hematocrits checked .
She was kept NPO until January 26 when she began to feel hungry .
At that time clear liquids were started .
All of her stools were guaiaced .
She also began Nadolol 40 mg QD to reduce her portal hypertension .
The GI consult team continued to follow her .
We also tried to contact her physician at Va Sit Namar Healthcare and was unsuccessful .
Therefore we decided to work up her cirrhosis .
She was described as having _______ cirrhosis and we decided that we wanted to try to figure out the etiology .
Her ferritin and iron studies did not reveal any evidence of hemochromatosis and her hep serologies were all negative .
She also had negative antimitochondrial antibody and she also had no evidence of ceruloplasmin .
Over the course of her admission were also sent an alpha-1-antitrypsin , which was negative .
She did very well over the course of her admission with no evidence of further bleeding .
Her hematocrit stayed stable at approximately 32 .
We also did an ultrasound guided paracentesis .
The peritoneal fluid showed a glucose of 244 , total protein 0.8 and a albumin of 0.5 , globulin 0.3 , amylase 16 , LDH of 51 .
The serum albumin gradient was 1.8 consistent with portal hypertension .
The cell count showed a white blood cell count of 160 with 16% polys .
She therefore _________ criteria for a spontaneous bacterial peritonitis .
Her platelet count stayed persistently low and we decided that it might be due to Cimetidine .
Therefore we switched her Cimetidine to Prilosec .
By the 2th the patient was feeling very well and desired to transfer or discharge to home .
She wanted to be closer to North Dakota .
After discussion with her private physician , Dr. Joasscchird , tel. 090-249-6079 , at Va Sit Namar Healthcare and Dr. Acrookesjo at Do Of Hospital , the patient was judged to be fit for discharge and she was sent home with AH and physical therapy .
She was quite able to climb stairs on her own in the hospital .
She is to follow up with Dr. Acrookesjo in one week and Dr. Work the gastrointestinal fellow here at PUOMC in 2 weeks .
She may require a repeat upper endoscopy study to see if she needs any rebanding .
The patient however complained of a persistent wheeze with beta blocker , therefore it was agreed that we would stop the beta blocker until the patient was followed up as an outpatient .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Zoloft 50 mg PO QD , Lactulose 15 g PO BID , Synthroid 0.15 mg PO QD , Prilosec 20 mg PO BID .

3. biliary obstruction .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy , 05/05/94 .
Gastrojejunostomy , 05/08/94 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 111y year old female who presented initially to the Medical service on 05/01 complaining of weight loss , nausea , vomiting and abdominal distention .
She reported that she was remarkably healthy until the latter part of 12/93 , when her granddaughter noticed her to be jaundiced .
Since that time she had yellow colored stools .
On 01/24 she was taken to the Rys Memorial Hospital hospital , where she was diagnosed with choledocholithiasis .
An ERCP showed stones in the common bile duct but they could not be recovered .
Therefore she was transferred to Ph University Of Medical Center and admitted there from 01/25 - 02/03 .
An ERCP was repeated and it was noted that she had a severely dilated common bile duct which contained stones .
The distal portion of the duct was narrowed and a papillotomy was performed , which drained pus from the common bile duct .
The stones were then removed .
The distal narrowing was dilated and cytology was sent , revealing markedly atypical cells with inflammation .
She was discharged home .
Approximately one month prior to admission she developed anorexia , increased abdominal girth , weight loss of 15 lb , and nausea and vomiting .
She presented to the emergency room , where a nasogastric tube was placed and drained approximately 400 of green-brown , thick fluid .
She was admitted for workup of her symptoms .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As above ; appendectomy in 1916 , hysterectomy in 1941 , mastoid surgery in 1970 , shingles of right arm in 1994 .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Aspirin daily .
ALLERGIES :
She has no known drug allergies .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient lives with her children in Co Darburg and is quite active .
She is originally from Tbalt .
She does not smoke and has rare alcohol intake .
FAMILY HISTORY :

Her mother died of an unspecified tumor .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was a pleasant elderly female in no acute distress .
Vital signs :
temperature 98.4 , blood pressure 116/60 , pulse 76 , respirations 18 .
HEENT :
sclerae anicteric , pupils equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation , extra ocular movements intact , oropharynx mildly dry .
The neck was supple with shotty lymphadenopathy , 2+ carotids without bruits .
Cardiac :
regular rate and rhythm without murmur .
Chest :
a few bibasilar crackles ; otherwise clear to auscultation .
Abdomen :
distended , bowel sounds present , tympanitic to percussion anteriorly , dull to percussion laterally .
No guarding or rebound .
Extremities :
no edema .
Breasts :
no masses , lesions or nipple discharge .
No axillary lymphadenopathy .
Neurological :
alert and oriented x 3 .
Cranial nerves II-XII intact .
LABORATORY DATA :
White count 13.8 , hematocrit 33 , platelet count 353,000 .
Sodium 141 , potassium 3.8 , chloride 94 , bicarbonate 31 , BUN 19 , creatinine 1.0 , glucose 218 , alkaline phosphatase 634 , LDH 212 , SGOT 30 , bilirubin 0.8 direct , total bilirubin 1.2 .
Sed rate 100 .
PT 11.8 , PTT 23.9 .
KUB :
Large , approximately 30 cm stomach filled with fluid .
Chest x-ray :
clear lungs .
EKG :
left bundle branch block , left anterior descending , normal sinus rhythm at 90 , non-specific ST-T wave changes .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital for workup of a presumed obstructive process .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Gastroenterology service and it was decided that an esophagogastroduodenoscopy would be performed .
Prior to this study , however , a CT examination of the abdomen was obtained which showed a mass in the porta causing biliary ductal dilatation proximally and gastric outlet obstruction .
On 05/05 an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed , which showed gastric outlet obstruction , a deformed pylorus and a duodenal mass encasing and obstructing the lumen .
It appeared that there was a large tumor mass obstructing the duodenum and pylorus area , and therefore it was decided that she would benefit from a gastrojejunostomy for drainage of her stomach .
The General Surgery service was involved at this stage , and on 05/08 a posterior gastrojejunostomy with wedge liver biopsy was performed to facilitate gastric drainage .
Pathology of the liver biopsy revealed metastatic , moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma .
The patient did well postoperatively and had prompt return of bowel function .
However , on postoperative day #5 it was noticed that she had become acutely jaundiced , and her total bilirubin was found to be 7.2 with a direct bilirubin of 4.9 .
It was obvious that she had now obstructed her biliary tree , as her urine became dark and her stools clay colored .
After discussion with her family , it was decided that a stent would not be placed for biliary decompression and the patient was confirmed as a do not resuscitate status .
The patient 's subsequent hospital course was fairly uneventful .
She complained of fatigue but had a decent appetite .
As she has an obstructing cancer of the biliary tree and further palliative procedures were deferred , her life expectancy is rather limited .
The best course of action was placement in a nursing facility , as her family was unable to care for her at home .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. State is an 81-year-old man with a history of restrictive and obstructive lung disease , dilated cardiomyopathy , inferior myocardial infarction , and anterior mediastinal masses admitted with acute onset of pulmonary edema .
In the setting of inadvertently decreasing Lasix from 80 mg. po 40 mg. a day Mr. State had sudden onset dyspnea after approximate day and a half prodrome culminating in severe dyspnea .
Upon arrival in the Emergency Room Mr. State 's saturations were in the mid 80s and he was promptly rendered more comfortable with high flow oxygen , morphine , and nitrates and intravenous Lasix .

The patient denied angina , syncope , preceding worsening orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , palpitations , chest pain , hematemesis or melena .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Is notable for an inferior myocardial infarction , restrictive and obstructive lung disease with an FEV1 of .9 and FVC of 1.34 and a moderate at best response to bronchodilators , and a negative sestamibi scan in May , 1999 apart from a severe fixed inferolateral defect , systolic dysfunction with recent echocardiography revealing an LVID of 62 mm. and ejection fraction of 28 percent , moderate mitral regurgitation and mild-to-moderate aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 33 and a mean gradient of 19 and a valve area of 1.4 cm. squared .
In addition , Mr. State has an anterior mediastinal mass 2x2x1.7 cm. by recent computerized tomography scan without surrounding or adjacent adenopathy or parenchymal lung disease apart from bronchiectasis .
His cardiomyopathy work up entailed a negative ANA , negative SPEP , UPEP and Benz-Jones proteins , normal ferritin , thyroid stimulating hormone and a recent work up for possible bimomatous associated myasthenia gravis that was negative .
The patient lives on Quelene with his wife .
He is a non-smoker and drinks rare alcohol .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was a very pleasant man who appeared his stated age .
Blood pressure was 155/60 , heart rate 70 with occasional premature ventricular contractions , respirations 14 .
Mr. State was dyspneic speaking in short sentences initially on high flow oxygen .
Jugular venous pressure was 8 with a brisk inspiratory descent .
There was no thyromegaly .
Carotids were 2+ .
Breath sounds were decreased at the bases only with distant heart sounds and a 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur consistent with aortic stenosis with Gallavardin like radiation to the apex .
Abdomen :
soft , nontender with hepatosplenomegaly , or hepatojugular reflex , bruits or pulsations .
There was no rash and no edema and the neurological examination was non-focal .
LABORATORY DATA :
Notable for a sodium of 145 , potassium 3.6 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 104 , hematocrit 42 , white count 8.7 , platelet count 235 and a PT of 12.9 seconds .
The urinalysis was negative .
The Troponin I was less than .4 and the creatine kinase was 114 .
Chest x-ray revealed moderate cardiomegaly with no clear interstitial or alveolar pulmonary edema and chronic atelectasis and / or scarring at both lung bases .
The electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with premature atrial complexes and right bundle branch block with left anterior hemiblock and old anterior myocardial infarction .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Hospital and underwent an approximate 1.5 liter diuresis within the first 24 hours with improvement in his symptoms and improvement in his oxygen saturations .
After a long discussion with the patient and his family it was determined that a cardiac catheterization would be prudent .
Prior to catheterization a VQ scan was performed which revealed a moderate probability for PE with a subsegmental defect in the lingular on the left lung .
Subsequent lower extremities noninvasive studies and D-dimer test were both negative rendering the probability of acute pulmonary embolism less than 2 percent .
It was not felt that the patient would be in need of chronic Coumadin therapy in lieu of this low probability findings in toto .
Coronary angiography revealed occlusion of the right coronary artery proximally with insignificant plaquing in the left anterior descending artery and circumflex arteries .
After a approximate 3 liter total diuresis the right atrial pressure was 5 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 14 , pulmonary vacuolar resistance 353 and the cardiac output depressed at 2.95 liters per minute , or a cardiac index of 1.7 liters per minute .
Based upon these findings it was felt that Mr. State most likely has multi-factorial dyspnea owing to both his ventilatory limitation and to a chronic low output state .
In Hospital he was seen by both Speech Therapy , physical therapy , and the Uspend Harmemewood Medical Center Congestive Heart Failure Nurse Practitioner Program .
His Isordil was increased in Hospital and blood pressure control was relative episodic with systolic pressures ranging between 100 and 160 .
Future adjustments will be made at home pending his blood pressure measures .
At a goal weight of 142 pounds , Mr. State 's filling pressures appeared ideal with a wedge pressure of 14 and his goal weight range will be between 142 and 44 pounds at home .
The patient will be followed by Dr. State within a week of discharge and by Nieie Naebrand Freierm of the Dyathenslycha Medical Center .

7. Urinary tract infection .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 74 year old female with metastatic papillary carcinoma of the thyroid who presented to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital on 4/28/93 with progressive weakness , weight loss and shortness of breath .
The patient was in a good state of health until January of 1993 when she developed a serious upper respiratory tract infection associated with weakness and fatigue .
She had also reported a weight loss of 15 pounds over the past two months .
Although her upper respiratory tract infection seemed to be resolving , her weakness persisted .
A work up begun by her internist , Dr. Brain , revealed a white blood cell count of 49,000 with 50% eosinophils .
She was admitted to Box Memorial Hospital Nursing Home for further evaluation .
Data collected there included a chest x-ray which was unremarkable .
The liver function tests showed an alkaline phosphatase of 303 , LDH 310 , SGOT 66 , albumin 2.5 .
A peripheral blood smear showed mature eosinophils in increased numbers .
Chromosomal studies were negative .
A bone scan showed increased uptake at the manubrium at the site of an old fracture , as well as in the right supraclavicular area .
A thyroid ultrasound showed an inferior thyroid mass .
This was followed by an abdominal CT which showed an enlarged spleen , a lytic lesion on the right iliac bone and a benign renal cyst .
Biopsy of the lytic lesion was consistent with metastases papillary carcinoma of the thyroid .
An upper gastrointestinal was unremarkable .
The small bowel follow through was within normal limits .
A thyroid scan revealed decreased function and displacement of the thyroid by a cold mass located inferiorly with calcifications on the right side .
A chest CT also revealed a small pulmonary nodule with a necrotic mass involving the right lung posteriorly .
The patient was subsequently referred to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital under the service of Dr. Brain .
She continued to have profound weakness , a decreased appetite and weight loss .
She also developed lower extremity edema as well as left upper extremity swelling associated with increased shortness of breath on exertion .
A needle biopsy of the right thyroid nodule showed papillary thyroid carcinoma .
The patient reports no history of radiation exposure , no family history of thyroid carcinoma , no recent travels or exposure to tuberculosis .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Includes a history of atrial fibrillation with good heart rate control on Digoxin .
She reports no prior surgical history .
The patient also reports no known drug allergy .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient lives alone in Leschle Drive , Sonpo , and does not report a smoking or alcohol history .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Lanoxin , 0.25 mg po qd ; Lasix , 20 mg po qd .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient is a pleasant , elderly female in no acute distress .
Her vital signs showed a blood pressure of 126/72 , pulse 84 , respirations 22 , temperature 98.6 .
She had a 3 x 4 cm firm , nontender right thyroid mass that seemed to be fixed to the trachea .
She had no jugular venous distention or bruits .
The lungs exhibited right basilar dullness one quarter of the way up .
She had no definite S3 .
The liver edge was palpable to 6 cm below the right costal margin .
Her spleen could not be palpated .
She had 4+ edema to the knees bilaterally .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission the white blood count was 67.3 with a differential of 21% polys , 16% bands , 3% lymphocytes , 2% monocytes , 57% eosinophils and 1% myelocytes .
Her hematocrit was 38.8 , hemoglobin 13.7 , platelet count 155,000 , PT 12.7/10.1 , PTT 33.9 , erythrocyte sedimentation rate 18 , calcium 7.5 , phosphorus 3.5 , sodium 136 , potassium 3.7 , BUN 15 , total protein 5.9 , albumin 2.3 , globulin 3.6 , alkaline phosphatase 379 , SGOT 37 , Digoxin level 0.7 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to Dr. Shatermivaet S Brain on 4/28/93 with a history of papillary carcinoma of the thyroid with bone involvement and possible lung involvement .
Work up was begun for the possible myeloproliferative / myelodysplastic disorder associated with the hyper-eosinophilic syndrome .
Accordingly , an Oncology consult was called on 4/29/93 and a bone marrow aspirate biopsy was performed .
This revealed maturation of leukocytes to all stages with markedly increased eosinophilic proliferation .
A lung biopsy was performed on 4/30/93 without definitive results .
During this time the patient 's coagulation status had improved with Vitamin K therapy with PTs normalizing .
ANCA serum results were negative .
ANA results were also nonsuggestive .
The patient continued to suffer from edema of the left upper extremity and a Vascular Radiology consult revealed a thrombosis of the left subclavian vein extending into the axillary vein .
There was some thrombosis of the left internal jugular vein as well .
A head CT was performed and was completely negative for any metastatic process involving the brain .
Thus , a heparin sliding scale was begun .
Meanwhile , the patient 's eosinophilia was treated with a trial of prednisone .
She also developed a mild urinary tract infection which responded to Bactrim , but which was subsequently stopped because of diarrhea .
The conclusions at this time of the thyroid cytologist , as well as the bone pathologist , were that the findings were diagnostic of papillary thyroid carcinoma with pulmonary metastases .
Dr. Trial was subsequently consulted on 5/5 for surgical intervention .
On 5/6/93 the patient underwent a right thyroidectomy with sacrifice of the right recurrent laryngeal nerve as well as the right sternothyroid muscle and lower parathyroid gland .
She underwent autotransplantation of the right upper parathyroid gland , as well as repair of a right posterior membranous tracheotomy .
She was received in the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit immediately postoperatively in stable condition .
Her rate was well controlled on Digoxin .
The patient was transferred to the floor on 5/7 .
On the ward she continued a gentle diuresis as well as Solu-Medrol therapy .
Calcium levels remained 7.2 to 7.5 postoperatively .
She continued to improve with a slight hoarseness in her voice that was expected .
She continued to exhibit asymptomatic atrial fibrillation .
Anticoagulation was begun on the third postoperative day with Coumadin .
She was effectively anticoagulated with a PT in the range between 15 and 17 over a control of 10 .
She also received a Radiation Therapy consult for local control of her invasive carcinoma .
She did well on the ward and was discharged on her ninth postoperative day .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
Metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Coumadin , 5 mg po alternating with 2.5 mg po ; prednisolone , 30 mg po bid ; hydrochlorothiazide , 50 mg po bid ; potassium chloride , 40 mEq po bid ; Augmentin , 500 mg po tid ; Digoxin , 0.125 mg po qd ; Tylenol , 650 mg po q4h prn ; Carafate , 1 gram po bid ; Synthroid , 0.125 mg po qd .
DISPOSITION :
The patient was discharged home with Terchestlumnesamp Medical Center referral for weekly blood tests , potassium and PT .
The patient is also to keep her left arm elevated and to remain on a low sodium diet .
She will be maintained on a PT between 15 and 17 with Coumadin .

On 1/12/92 she was taken to the operating room where she underwent a neart total gastrectomy with a retrocolic Bill-Roth II gastrojejunostomy reconstruction .
In addition a small ventral hernia was noted upon abdominal exploration within a previous surgical incision .
This was repaired .
A needle jejunostomy catheter was placed at the time of her operation to facilitate postoperative nutrition .
With regards to the cancer , there was a large mass along the greater curvature in the body of the stomach , and several perigastric lymph nodes which were taken with the specimen .
In addition , there were at least two lymph nodes within the porta hepatis which were dissected free and taken en bloc with the specimen .

His coronary risk factors include cigarette smoking , obesity , a family history of coronary disease , and elevated serum cholesterol .
He also has a history of atrial fibrillation with sinus pauses during sleep apnea .
On June 4 , 1993 , he underwent cardiac catheterization .
He was found to have an occluded right coronary artery , 70% distal left main lesion , 80% proximal ramus lesion , and his left ventricular ejection shows preserved function except for akinesis of the inferior wall .
His ejection fraction was 50% , a carotid duplex study showed plaqueing but no critical lesions .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As above .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
He has a wife Pandeprob and lives in Ashing .
He did smoke up to three pack per day .
He has three children .
He is retired .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Six foot , 250 pounds .
He is a well appearing male , in no distress .
HIs blood pressure was 140/70 , pulse 80 and irregular .
His neck veins were not distended .
His carotids showed bilateral bruits .
His lungs are clear .
His cardiac exam shows a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur .
His abdomen is obese , but benign .
His peripheral pulses are intact .
He has no peripheral edema .
His Neurological exam is nonfocal .
LABORATORY DATA :
sodium 140 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 104 , CO2 30 , calcium 9.3 , phosphorous 1.2 , BUN 9 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 183 .
Uric acid 8.4 , bilirubin 0.7 , alkaline phosphatase 72 , amylase 46 , SGOT 20 , and his Digoxin level was 1.0 .
hematocrit 38% , white blood cell count 7700 , MCV 86 , PT and PTT were normal .
urinalysis was unremarkable .
His chest X-ray was normal with bilateral pleural thickening .
His electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation .
There were nonspecific ST and T wave changes .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to Hellworthston Hospital .
There , he stabilized , and was seen in consultation by Cardiology and Anesthesiology .
There was concern over his sleep apnea , but he appeared to have primarily cardiac disease and therefore because of the left main stenosis , it was reasonable to proceed .
On June 24 , 1993 , Dr. Lenni Breutzoln performed triple coronary bypass surgery .
He placed a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending , single saphenous vein to the posterior descending artery with 170 cc. per minute flow and a single saphenous vein to the circumflex with 140 cc. per minute flow .
He weaned easily off cardiopulmonary bypass .
He had no hemodynamic difficulties .
He was able to wean from the ventilator , but he did have marginal oxygenation throughout .
He did revert back to atrial fibrillation .
He was extubated within forty eight hours .
He was transferred out of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit on June 26 .
He reverted back to atrial fibrillation that required Digoxin , and Verapamil to control .
He could not be converted back to normal sinus rhythm even with a trial of Quinaglute .
He also had anemia and he was seen in consultation by the Nutrition Service .
He was advised to have an ideal body weight of 178 pounds , and clearly a 2300 calorie diet was appropriate for him .
Weight reduction would be important in the long term management of his coronary disease .
He was treated with Digoxin and Diuretics along with Ace inhibitors because of his depressed left ventricular function .
He was able to ambulate although somewhat slowly because of his rapid atrial fibrillation .
It was considered to obtain a pulmonary consultation on a formal basis , but it was then felt that he would do better by healing fully from his surgery , because he really had little in the way of pulmonary complications , despite the history of sleep apnea of an obstructive basis .
Primary in his long term management is cardiac rehabilitation with weight reduction .
He will be followed closely in 23 Hwy , Hamp by Dr. Laymie Aslinke .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital , on the Neurological Surgery Service of Lupevickette L. Ca , M.D.
Prior to his admission , the patient 's gunshot wound was sutured close in the emergency room .
The patient was placed on suicide precautions , and was hydrated with an infusion of intravenous fluid .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Psychiatry Service , who began a battery of testing , which continues at the time of discharge .
The Consulting Psychiatrist recommended a minimum of 2 point restraints at all times , and recommended the patient be monitored by a sitter .
Allowing the patient to ambulate was not recommended .
From a medical standpoint , the patient did well .
He was initially admitted to the Neurological Intensive Care Unit where he was closely monitored during the first two days of his hospitalization .
The chief obstacle was bringing his blood pressure under control and this was ultimately achieved with a combination of Captopril and Nifedipine .
After his blood pressure had stabilized , the patient was transferred to the Neurology Ward .
Close monitoring demonstrated his blood pressure to be stable and within an acceptable rang on his dosage regimen .
The Psychiatry Service followed up extensively with the patient , and his Psychiatric progress is detailed in the Psychiatry transfer note .
By the 7th hospital day , the patient was medically stable .
He had undergone full Psychiatric evaluation , and was prepared for transfer to a Psychiatric Hospital .
Therefore , because of his need for intense psychiatric care , the patient is discharged to the Vo Black Doylestrictshore Ft. Clinics Medical Center on the 7th hospital day .

She has been under the care of Dr. Aalv Manual and was referred here for further therapy .
She had no prior significant cardiac history and presented to her local medical doctor 's office with an episode of severe retrosternal chest pain .
Her electrocardiogram showed a new right bundle branch block and left anterior hemiblock .
The patient was transferred to the Gemenadentoolpai Medical Center and was admitted .
Her hospital course was remarkable for ruling in for a myocardial infarction with a peak CPK of 9,379 units with a 5.9% MB fraction .
In addition , on telemetry she developed complete heart block and hypotension requiring temporary pacing wire and then a permanent pacemaker implantation on 08-03-93 .
She developed congestive heart failure and required pressor support .
She underwent cardiac catheterization on 8-15-93 and was found to have a left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 28 millimeters of mercury .
She had a dominant right coronary artery with minor disease .
The main left coronary artery had a 20% stenosis .
The left anterior descending had a severe 80% proximal stenosis with a filling defect consistent with intraluminal thrombus .
The circumflex artery had a minor 40% stenosis .
Cine left ventriculogram revealed a dilated left ventricle with an area of anterolateral , apical , and septal akinesis .
The left ventricular ejection fraction was estimated to 38% .
The patient was transferred to the Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center for consideration of coronary angioplasty .
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS :
Her risk factors for coronary artery disease included a positive family history and an elevated cholesterol level .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Her past medical history is remarkable for a history of Parkinson 's disease .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Her physical examination at the time of admission revealed a pleasant lady in no acute distress .
The blood pressure was 120/70 millimeters of mercury .
Her pulse was regular at 80 beats per minute .
The jugular venous pressure was elevated at 6 cm above the sternal angle .
The carotids were normal .
The chest was clear .
The cardiac examination revealed anapical impulse in the fifth left intercostal space , left to mid clavicular line .
The first sound was normal .
The second sound was normally split .
She had no murmurs and no gallops .
The examination the abdomen was benign .
The examination of the extremities showed no edema .
She had good pulses bilaterally .
LABORATORY DATA :
Her electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm , left atrial enlargement , left axis deviation , poor R-wave progression in V1 through V4 , consistent with marked clockwise rotation , cannot rule out an old anteroseptal wall myocardial infarction .
There were prominent Q-waves in AVL , consistent with lateral myocardial infarction .
There were non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Medical Service .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Department because of the history of Parkinson 's disease .
The patient was maintained on intravenous heparin .

WORD DISABILITY AND PROBABLY DURATION :
The patient is disabled .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. Kotereef is a 93-year-old woman who was transferred from Daleglo Medical Center with renal insufficiency .
The patient was in her usual state of health until 7/10/98 when she was admitted to the Daleglo Medical Center with a chief complaint of falling and mental status changes .
She was initially treated for heart failure and pneumonia and , on the night of admission , she experienced a fever to 104 , acute respiratory distress and required intubation for two days .
The patient was noted to have a CPK of 150 with 11.8 percent MB but no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes .
She was treated for congestive heart failure and was diuresed and extubated .
She was transferred to the floor where initially she did very well but subsequently developed an elevated BUN and creatinine and failure to eat .
The patient 's granddaughter requested that she be transferred to the Ph University Of Medical Center where she had been cared for in the past for her myocardial infarction as well as cerebrovascular disease .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Her past medical history is notable for congestive heart failure with a last ejection fraction noted to be 28 percent in April of 1997 .
She also has a history of urinary tract infection .
She has a history of diverticulosis with lower GI bleeds .
In 01/95 she was admitted with a cerebral vascular accident notable for right facial droop and left-sided weakness .
There was marked improvement in these symptoms thereafter , and the patient was discharged on Coumadin which was subsequently discontinued .
The patient also has a history of myocardial infarction in 1977 and 1987 and underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting X4 in 1987 .
She also has a history of polymyalgia rheumatica with a bilateral temporal artery being biopsied and being negative for temporal arteritis .
She also has a history of right proximal femur fracture and internal fixation in 1995 .
On arrival to the Ph University Of Medical Center the patient stated that she had not had a bowel movement for many days and that she had no appetite .
However , she denied any chest pain , dyspnea or syncope .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination her pulse was 55 .
Her systolic blood pressure was 110 .
She appeared to be very dry with very dry mucosa .
Her lungs had few rhonchi , no rales .
Her cardiac exam was irregular but her heart sounds were distant .
Her abdomen showed active bowel sounds , was nontender and she had no pedal edema .
LABORATORY DATA :
Laboratory data was notable for hematocrit of 33.5 , white count of 14.7 , platelet count of 270 .
BUN 112 , creatinine 2.3 , sodium 142 , potassium 4.2 , CO2 23.4 , and chloride 104 .
A chest x-ray revealed clear lungs on a portable chest x-ray without evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema .
A KUB showed a large loop of dilated bowel but no free air and a tortuous calcified aorta .
An electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with evidence of an old inferior myocardial infarction and right bundle branch block .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted to Goman 25 where she was hydrated for the presumed diagnosis of pre-renal azotemia .
A urinalysis was notable for pyuria with 50 to 100 white cells , and the patient was begun on Levofloxacin for presumed polymicrobial urinary tract infection .
A head CT scan was performed which showed multiple old ischemic infarcts in the right frontal and cerebellar lobes .
There was diffuse atrophy and no evidence of recent bleed .
The patient was evaluated by the rheumatology service who noted that the patient 's diagnosis was most consistent with rheumatoid arthritis and possibly PMR .
The patient had been followed by Dr. Friednantflirt of the Ph University Of Medical Center .
At that time she was noted to have undergone bilateral temporal artery biopsies , both of which were negative for temporal arteritis .
The recommendation from the rheumatology service was to attempt to decrease her Prednisone to 5 mg PO q.day with an eye on a change in the severity of her shoulder arthritis symptoms .
On the third hospital day the patient developed a sudden change in her mental status while taking pills .
She was noted to be arousable and responsive and minimally conversation .
However , she was unable to move her right arm or leg .
Her eyes were deviated to the left and she had a right facial droop .
The patient was taken to the emergent CAT scan which revealed no acute bleeding and was felt to be a cerebral vascular occlusion .
The patient was evaluated by the Stroke Service , which recommended a lumbar puncture which was performed and did not reveal evidence of meningitis .
A cardiac ultrasound was performed which revealed an ejection fraction of 50 percent with wall motion abnormalities in the inferior septal and inferior walls involving the apex .
There was trace mitral regurgitation .
Multiple aortic valve leaflets were thickened without stenosis .
There was no evidence of an intraventricular thrombus .
The patient was initially treated by increasing her aspirin from 81 mg to 325 mg .
She was also continued to be hydrated .
Her blood pressure medications were held to allow increased cerebral perfusion .
After careful discussion with the neurology service , it was felt that the patient was at too great a risk to be started and maintained on anticoagulant therapy and therefore she was treated conservatively .
The patient was subsequently evaluated by the speech pathology service , the physical therapy service and the occupational therapy service for evaluation for her recovery from her stroke .
Her BUN and creatinine continued to decrease with hydration and Zestril was re-initiated and , as her blood pressure allowed , her Isordil was re-initiated and then her Zestril was increased to 10 mg PO q.day .
Digoxin was discontinued because of her improved left ventricular ejection fraction .
The patient did have a steady decrease in her hematocrit to a minimum of 26.2 and received one unit of packed red blood cells with restoration of her hematocrit over 30 .
Her ferritin was 83 and there was no evidence of guaiac positive stools .
It was elected to defer further evaluation of her anemia at this time .
However , if she became more evidently guaiac positive it would be appropriate to evaluate the source of bleeding in her colon and potentially in her esophagus and stomach .
Nevertheless , the patient was switched from aspirin to Plavix 75 mg PO q.day in view of her history of lower GI bleeding .
Major consideration toward the end of the patient 's hospitalization was whether or not she would be able to take adequate PO intake to maintain her volume status .
Initially it was felt that the patient would require gastroscopy .
However , with the assistance of the patient 's granddaughter , the patient was able to increase her po intake with a lot of assistance .
The patient 's granddaughter felt that it was likely that her PO intake would improve when she returned home to the nursing home .
I discussed this with the granddaughter and told her that if her PO intake was inadequate , that gastrostomy tube would be reasonable in the future and that we would be available to assist in this as it became necessary .
The patient was evaluated by the GI service who thought that a PEG would be quite feasible and that they would be delighted to do this if it was necessary and the patient and family agreed .
Nevertheless , we have decided to postpone this issue for now and to see how she does when she returns to the nursing home .
The patient will be transferred tomorrow to Naplesvillechaelty .
I will get in touch with Dr. Areas and please do not hesitate to contact me if I can provide any additional information .
My direct pager is 935-131-3314 .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 75 year old female with a history of psychotic depression with paranoia who presents status post a few days of incontinence , increased confusion , and collapse .
The patient who has a baseline mental status / psychiatric impairment was reported to be increasingly confused and paranoid over the past few days .
She was reportedly incontinent of urine and diaphoretic .
The family also reported that the patient "" collapsed "" one day prior to admission , as her legs gave out .
Her PO intake has also decreased .
She was brought to the Ph University Of Medical Center Emergency Ward by ambulance , where she was found to be confused , oriented to self and family only , and with dry mucous membranes .
The head computerized tomography scan on admission to the emergency room revealed moderate to severe cortical atrophy without evidence of acute bleed or subdural hemorrhage .
The patient denies shortness of breath , chest pain or abdominal pain .
The patient has a history of major depression / psychotic depression since at least 1988 .
She does have paranoid features .
The patient has a history of near syncope in 1988 and also a history of dehydration .
Currently the patient is unable to provide history .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As outlined above .
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
vitamin B12 shots monthly .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient lives with elderly siblings .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Mother with depression .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Elderly obese woman lying comfortably in bed in no acute distress .
The vital signs revealed blood pressure 150/83 , heart rate 84 , respirations 20 per minute and temperature 98.8 degrees Fahrenheit .
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was unremarkable .
The lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally .
Heart :
regular rate and rhythm with normal Sl and S2 .
The abdomen was benign .
Extremities :
revealed one plus edema bilaterally .
The neurological examination revealed that the patient was alert and oriented only to self .
She answers inappropriately to questions .
She is not cooperative with the full neurological examination but she did move all four extremities .
LABORATORY DATA :
revealed sodium 141 , potassium 3.8 , chloride 106 , bicarbonate 26.4 , BUN 21 , creatinine 1.0 , glucose was 124 .
The amylase was 37 .
The complete blood count revealed a white blood cell count of 11,900 ; hematocrit of 38 and platelet count of 207,000 ; the tox screen was negative .
The prothrombin time was 10.1 and partial thromboplastin time 28.5 .
The electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm at 78 with axis of 0 degrees and normal intervals .
There were no ST-T wave changes .
Head computerized tomography scan revealed diffuse cortical atrophy , increased ventricles and no acute bleed .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM :
1. Dehydration .
The patient was mildly dehydrated at time of admission and was replaced with intravenous fluids until she began taking good PO intake .
By the end of her hospitalization she was eating well on her own .
2. Infectious Disease .
Admission urinalysis revealed 5-10 red blood cells , 10-20 white blood cells and few bacteria .
Therefore the patient was started on Bactrim for urinary tract infection .
She did not tolerate oral medication initially and was switched to intravenous ampicillin .
The antibiotics were discontinued after three days of intravenous antibiotic therapy .
A repeat urinalysis done later in the course of the hospitalization revealed no white blood cells .
3. Psychiatric .
The patient underwent neuropsychiatric testing .
This evaluation revealed a woman with multifaceted loss of intellectual functioning who falls well within the range of SDAT group .
Conclusion was that this was a dementing process .
The testing was performed by a staff neuropsychologist , Dr. Lornsook Trusmoag , PhD , telephone number 959-1490 .
She stated that she would be happy to reevaluate Ms. Fleetheesc in the future if necessary .
4. Parotid swelling .
Approximately five days into the hospital stay it was noted that the patient had significant right parotid swelling .
Plain films revealed soft tissue swelling , neck and face computerized tomography scan revealed a nonspecific enlarged right parotid gland with increased attenuation consistent with an inflammatory or neoplastic process .
The patient had refused intravenous contrast so a contrast study was not available .
The patient was evaluated by ENT who felt that her enlargement was more likely secondary to an inflammatory process although they could not rule out malignancy .
They recommended that a cytology sample be obtained and sent and that the patient be treated with a 14 day course of Keflex .
Cytology consult was called , but by the time the cytologist came to do a fine needle aspiration the mass had shrunken to the point where there was nothing to aspirate .
It was felt that attempting a biopsy and beginning antibiotic treatment was not indicated at this time as the mass had entirely resolved .
The ENT physician who saw the patient is Dr. Freieslowkays .
The patient was scheduled to follow up with Dr. Freieslowkays on January 8 , 1994 at 1:20 p.m. at the Purckecation Balpoingdelt Pabarnes- Campa Memorial Hospital .
The phone number is 610-7597 .
5. Physical Therapy .
The patient 's baseline is that she is able to walk with the assistance of her brother or sister at home .
However , she has been reluctant to even move from the bed to the chair since admission to the Ph University Of Medical Center .
Physical Therapy has been working with her .
Fear of falling seems to be a large component of this , and the patient will likely need considerable patience in convincing her it is okay to get out of bed again .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Esophageal carcinoma-metastatic .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Lymphangetic pulmonary carcinomatosis , dyspnea .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Bronchoscopy , 3/23/95 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Po is a 53 year-old white male with a history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus who is admitted with a 10-day history of progressive dyspnea on exertion .
Briefly , Mr. Po presented in 1992 with dysphagia and a midesophageal mass that proved to be squamous cell carcinoma .
He received two cycles of neoadjuvant Cisplatin and 5-FU , followed by esophagectomy , followed by two cycles of adjuvant platinum/5-FU .
He was without evidence of disease until the May of 1994 , when he developed an inferior vena cava thrombosis and CT scan revealed celiac axis adenopathy .
By October of 1994 , pulmonary disease , consistent with lymphangetic spread of tumor , was present .
He began Ifosfamide chemotherapy but in the last few cycles has had progressive disease .
Over the last 10 days , he has been bothered by progressive dyspnea on exertion .
He has seen two local physicians , who have tried him first on Bactrim and subsequently Clarithromycin without improvement .
He denies fevers , chills , hemoptysis , chest pain , nausea and vomiting , or diarrhea .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1) Remarkable for a history of ulcers .
2) Inferior vena cava occlusion .
3) Arthritis .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Atrovent , Proventil , Azmacort , Serevent inhalers .
Coumadin , Tagamet , and Clarithromycin .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission , the patient is afebrile , tachypneic , and tachycardic .
Skin is pale .
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat exam reveals mild proptosis .
He has total alopecia .
His neck is supple .
There is no thyroid , cervical , or supraclavicular adenopathy .
His lungs reveal diffuse wheezes , especially in the left chest .
There is minimal air movement on the left lower lobe .
The rest of his physical examination was unremarkable .
LABORATORY DATA :
Laboratory studies on admission included a BUN and creatinine of 14 and 1.4 , normal calcium , white count of 12,100 , hematocrit of 32 , platelet count of 319,000 .
PT was 19.8 seconds .
His three liter nasal prong blood gas revealed a PO2 of 63 , PCO2 of 47 , pH of 7.39 .
A chest X-ray revealed diffuse air space disease , particularly on the left .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with a diagnostic impression of probable progressive carcinoma with a potential component of bronchospasm .
However , there was the possibility that this represented an atypical pulmonary infection .
Hence , he went to bronchoscopy by Dr. Jesclinke on 4/22/95 .
Bronchoscopy revealed clear airways without evidence of significant secretions .
BAL was sent for culture and was negative for pathogenic organisms .
A few days after bronchoscopy , his intravenous Bactrim was discontinued and he was treated with oxygen , steroids , and inhalers .
It was felt that there were no further chemotherapy options for this disease and he met with hospice therapy .
In addition , he was hypoxic throughout his admission , often with oxygen saturations in the high 80s despite five liters of supplemental oxygen .
This was accompanied with some anxiety , which was treated with intermittent morphine and Ativan .
The patient was discharged on Mar 30 , 1995 with hospice care .
His status is DNR .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Tagamet , 800 mg. PO q.day ; five liters of supplemental oxygen ; Carafate , 1 gm. b.i.d. ; Ativan , 1 mg. SL q.4 p.r.n.

Zestril 5 mg PO q.day , Nitropatch .2 mg once daily , Sotalol 120 mg PO b.i.d. , Lasix 20 mg PO b.i.d. , Coumadin as directed .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 72 year old male with a history of coronary artery disease .
He had experienced three myocardial infarctions since 1988 .
He presented with sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in December , 1994 and was admitted to Tecal Galecounxopt Community Hospital .
The coronary angiogram performed during his hospitalization had revealed 95% of left anterior descending artery disease and diffuse left circumflex disease .
An echocardiogram had revealed an ejection fraction of 41% with apicalakinesis .
He had undergone electrophysiology study and his incessant ventricular tachycardia was interrupted by transcatheter radio frequency ablation .
After the ablation procedure , programmed stimulation had initiated another ventricular tachycardia with distinct surface QRS configuration but since there was no spontaneous ventricular tachycardia , the other forms were not pursued vigorously .
The patient was discharged while on procainamide and Coumadin .
On March 8 , he developed palpitations with shortness of breath and chest pain .
The patient was admitted to an outside hospital in Xingwa Moineswest where a wide complex tachycardia with a rate of 160 beats per minute was demonstrated .
The tachycardia had not responded to intravenous lidocaine or procainamide but has responded to intravenous verapamil .
The patient was transferred to Tecal Galecounxopt Community Hospital for further evaluation .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
The past medical history is notable for hypertension , left ventricular aneurysm and deep venous thrombosis which he experienced one month ago after the radio frequency ablation .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission physical examination , he was a well developed , well nourished elderly man in slightly dyspneic and uncomfortable condition .
His blood pressure was 130/80 millimeters of mercury , and pulse was 80 beats per minute .
The carotids were 2+ on both sides with bruits on each side .
The jugular venous pressure was 7 centimeters .
Lung examination revealed crackling rales over the bases of both lungs .
Cardiovascular exam :
normal Sl and S2 .
The abdomen was benign .
Extremities :
no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
LABORATORY DATA :
The chest X-ray showed mild cardiomegaly .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Step Down Unit .
The patient continued to experience multiple episodes of sustained and nonsustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia .
Intravenous procainamide was started , which reduced the frequency and the duration of the ventricular tachycardia .
On March 11 , the patient underwent an electrophysiology study .
During the study , ventricular tachycardia with a cycle length of 510 milliseconds was reproducibly induced by extra stimuli delivered from the right ventricular apex .
Pace mapping studies had demonstrated that the origin of the tachycardia to be in the inferior , lateral and apical left ventricle .
After mapping of the tachycardia , radio frequency ablation was carried out with four current applications , terminating the ventricular tachycardia in three of the four times .
After radio frequency ablation , no sustained ventricular tachycardias occurred .
However , there were periods of supraventricular tachycardias with a rate of 160-180 beats per minute and the patient was placed on sotalol .
Since the patient was known to have multiple different ventricular tachycardias , automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator therapy was also offered to the patient .
The patient agreed to proceed with automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator therapy .
On March 17 , the patient was taken to the Pacemaker Laboratory and a transvenous lead for the automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator ( CPI Endotak C 0074 ) was placed .
Then , the patient was transferred to the operating room and a Ventak PRX model 1705 automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator system was implanted .
The defibrillation threshold was less than or equal to 20 joules on several consecutive attempts .
The patient 's postoperative course was uneventful .
On March 19 , the patient was taken back to the Electrophysiology Laboratory where noninvasive programmed stimulation and automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator testing were performed .
Under brief propafol anesthesia , rapid ventricular tachycardia was induced by ramp pacing .
This was properly detected and converted to normal sinus rhythm with a single 34 joule countershock .
Three zones were programmed in the cardiac defibrillator .
For tachycardias with heart rate between 110 and 140 beats per minute , no therapy was programmed .
For tachycardias with heart rates between 140 and 175 , anti-tachycardia pacing followed by cardioversion is programmed .
For tachycardias faster than 175 beats per minute , cardioversion and defibrillation was programmed .
VVI pacing at 40 beats per minute was also programmed .
The patient felt good on the morning of March 20 .
The patient was discharged home in stable condition on the regimen described above .
He will have his prothrombin time checked on Monday and will follow up with the Defibrillator Clinic .

9. Vitamin B and folate injections .
ALLERGIES :
The patient has no known drug allergies .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination , the patient was an uncomfortable appearing elderly male who was not complaining of pain .
His vital signs included a blood pressure of 150/70 , pulse 66 , respirations 17 , temperature 98.3 .
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was remarkable for a jugular venous distention of eight centimeters .
The carotids were without bruits .
Crackles were heard two thirds of the way up of the lung base on the right and one half the way up on the left .
Cardiovascular exam :
S3 and S4 were heard , but no murmur or rub were noted .
The point of maximal impulse was not palpable .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .
The rectal examination was unremarkable .
Extremities :
within normal limits .
The neurological examination was unremarkable .
LABORATORY DATA :
Included a sodium of 141 , potassium 3.5 , chloride 103 , bicarbonate 26.9 , BUN and creatinine 45/2.5 , glucose 59 , white blood count 8.9 , hemoglobin 8.8 , hematocrit 26.5 , platelet count 172,000 , prothrombin time 9.5 , partial thromboplastin time 27.8 .
The urinalysis revealed 10-20 white blood cells , 10-20 red blood cells .
Admission chest X-ray showed some cephalization of flow and an irregular right hemidiaphragm .
The electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm at 65 beats per minute , with biphasic T 's in I , IV , V1 and T2 .
ST depression and biphasic T 's were noted in V3 through V6 .
No Q waves were noted .
Picture was believed to be consistent with anteroseptal ischemia , right bundle branch block , and question of left bundle branch block .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for further evaluation and definite treatment of his cardiac disease , as well as evaluation of his chronic renal insufficiency and multiple medical problems .
He underwent numerous preoperative radiologic studies , including a transcranial Doppler , which revealed moderate to severe right PICA stenosis but no evidence of disease in the vertebrals , proximal basilars , posterior communicating arteries , middle cerebral arteries , anterior cerebral arteries , or ophthalmic systems .
He also underwent a preoperative renal scan which showed decreased perfusion bilaterally , and borderline asymmetric renal function , 57% left , 43% right .
The renal ultrasound revealed normal kidneys bilaterally with no evidence of hydronephrosis .
The impression of the Renal consultant was that the patient 's renal function was likely secondary to mild ischemic acute tubular necrosis and hypoperfusion .
No evidence of cholesterol emboli were noted .
On 8-27-92 , the patient was brought to the Operating Room where he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting with left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending , reversed saphenous vein graft to circumflex , sequential reversed saphenous vein to acute marginal and posterior left ventricular artery .
Mr. Ear did well in the postoperative period and continued to be followed closely by the Cardiology , Renal , and Diabetes and Cardiac Surgery Services .
The patient was then extubated on the second postoperative day in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .
He did have some trouble with postoperative hypertension , with systolics to the 150 's and was placed on Captopril , 6.25 mg PO t.i.d.
His blood pressure subsequently came under better control and his Captopril was discontinued .
His renal function slowly improved throughout his postoperative course and by the day prior to discharge , his BUN and creatinine were 48 and 1.9 .
Dr. Freiermthalskush felt that this represented an appropriate improvement in the patient 's acute tubular necrosis , and that he was probably approaching his baseline renal function .
On the sixth postoperative day , he was transferred out of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit to the regular floor , without incident .
He did well subsequently with good control of his blood glucoses and blood pressures .
The patient is being transferred to Nacalv Medical Center in stable condition , with his sternal wounds healing well .
His saphenous vein graft donor site has been seeping somewhat and his stitches and staples will remain in to be removed during his postoperative office visit .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
NPH 12 units and regular CZI 25 units qa.m. , CZI sliding scale prn , Digoxin .125 mg PO q.day , Ecotrin , 1 PO q.day , Ferrous sulfate 325 mg PO t.i.d. , Folate 1 mg PO q.day , Reglan 10 mg PO t.i.d. , Synthroid 0.5 mg PO q.day , Lasix 40 mg PO q.day , potassium chloride prn .
Dr. Kotekeese , the patient 's diabetes consultant , noted that the patient 's morning regular insulin was new , and suggested that a premixed NPH regular 70/30 insulin might prove to be appropriate for him .
The patient 's diet is a no added salt / no concentrated sweets diet .

Interstitial lung disease , mitral regurgitation , systolic hypertension , status post myocardial infarction , transurethral resection of prostate , inguinal hernia repair , shingles , cataracts , ulcer disease , gout , mediastinal mass , thymoma .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Right heart catheterization .
ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS :

CLINICAL INFECTIONS :
None .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Nertland is an 84-year-old man who was admitted with decompensated heart failure .
The patient has a long standing history of significant left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe mitral regurgitation and moderate aortic stenosis .
He was recently hospitalized at the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for repeat cardiac catheterization .
After a comprehensive assessment , Drs. Sieh and Shufffyfe did not recommend operative repair of severe mitral regurgitation or aortic stenosis .
He was thus discharged with plans for continued medical therapy of his coronary artery disease .
Unfortunately , the patient continued to deteriorate and was readmitted for an attempt at hemodynamic tailoring and possible inotropic support .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Is notable for above .
For long standing dilated cardiomyopathy , severe mitral regurgitation and moderate aortic stenosis with a calculated aortic valve area of 1.1 by previous catheterization .
The patient had limited coronary artery disease with an occluded right coronary artery collateralized from the left system .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was a well appearing pleasant man who was dyspneic on the examining table .
Initial blood pressure was 95/65 , heart rate 80 and regular .
Respiratory rate was 14 .
Jugular venous pressure was 7 with modest hepatojugular reflex .
The carotids were 2+ and the lungs were notable for diminished breath sounds with inspiratory rhonchi .
The point of maximum impulse was displaced and the first and second heart sounds were unremarkable with a 2/6 murmur of mitral regurgitation .
There was no S3 gallop .
Abdomen was soft and non-tender and the rest of the examination was notable only for a slightly diminished pulses and poor perfusion .
LABORATORY DATA :
Notable for a sodium of 144 , potassium 3.7 , BUN 43 , creatinine 1.8 , albumin 3.0 , hematocrit 36 , white count 9.5 , platelet count 254 and a negative urinalysis .
A chest x-ray revealed moderate cardiomegaly with modest edema and the electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm with left axis deviation , previous inferior apical infarct and right bundle branch block .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent right heart catheterization which revealed a right atrial pressure of 11 , pulmonary artery pressure of 55/25 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 26 and a cardiac output of 2.7 liters per minute .
The PA line was kept in place while the patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit where he underwent an attempt at hemodynamic tailoring .
Initially Nipride was begun with some augmentation of the cardiac index but eventually a fall of the cardiac index to 1.8 .
The patient was then begun on Milrinone to a dose of .4 mcg. per kg. per minute with improvement in his cardiac index to approximately 2.0 and a corresponding fall in his filling pressures .
Because of the increased ectopy that appeared to be temporally associated with this infusion , the patient was switched to Dobutamine and titrated to a dose of 250 mcg. per minute .
On Dobutamine the cardiac index was 2.4-2.7 and at the end of his hemodynamic tailoring which included vigorous diuresis and the addition of Isordil and Captopril back to his chronic medical program , the patient 's right atrial pressure was 6 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 9 and the cardiac index was 2.7 .
Systemic vascular resistance was 900 .
The patient was then decannulated and sent to the floor with improvement in his central hemodynamics .
Over the subsequent days of his hospitalization , the patient had adjustment of his diuretic program .
At discharge his goal weight will be 120 pounds and he will be maintained on a chronic Dobutamine infusion at 250 mcg. per minute .
Should he tachy phylax to this which is inevitable , he will be begun on a home Milrinone infusion per previous protocol .
The patient on the dose of Dobutamine noted , had little in the way of resting symptoms and was without paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and orthopnea and able to ambulate approximately 100-150 feet without dyspnea .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Lasix 20 mg. q.day .
Isordil 10 mg. t.i.d. Aldactone 25 mg. q.d. Digoxin .125 mg. q.d. Plavix 75 mg. q.d. Allopurinol 100 mg. q.d.
Serevent and Flovent inhalers the patient b.i.d. Zoloft 25 mg. q.d. Nexium 40 mg. b.i.d. Captopril 25 mg. t.i.d. Zocor 20 mg. q.d. Seroquel 25 mg. q.d.
The patient will be maintained with a goal weight of 120 pounds .
Should his weight fall below 118 pounds , then he has been instructed to hold his Lasix .
Should his weight increase above 122 pounds , then the patient will take 40 mg. of Lasix a day .
FOLLOW UP :
He will be followed closely by Dr. Sieh and Mizy Flomhemp of the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Heart Failure Program .
In addition he will seen as necessary by Dr. Ri Tlandmaul of the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Psychiatry Service .

no evidence of pulmonary emboli .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Given the localization of the hematoma and the history of hypertension , the most likely cause for Mrs. Dua 's cerebellar hemorrhage is hypertension .

At the time of discharge , Mrs. Dua has had a remarkable recovery .
She is now able to walk fitfully and use her left hand with no problem .
The exam is remarkable for a mild leftsided face , arm and leg weakness and sensory deficit that should further improve with physical therapy and occupational therapy help .
She will be followed by the OT / PT dept. for that .
Her hypertension was difficult to manage initially and required three days of Intensive Care Unit with A-line and Nipride intravenously .
It was finally under control with high doses of Captopril , Nifedipine , and hydrochlorothiazide .
The workup to rule out secondary cause of hypertension given the patient 's young age and the difficulty controlling the blood pressure was started as an inpatient and will be completed by Dr. ______________as an outpatient .
So far no secondary causes of hypertension were identified but causes like lymphocytic ? chromocytoma or renal artery stenosis have not been ruled out yet .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. po q.day , Captopril 75 mg. po three times a day , Nifedipine 40 mg. po three times a day .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
