for a rule out MI protocol .\nHe was treated with aspirin , heparin , and intravenous nitroglycerin .\nNo beta blockers was started because of his history of hypertension with beta blockers and because his blood pressure of only 110\/70 .\nThe patient ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak CPK of 219 and 20.9% MB fraction .\nThis was a non-Q wave myocardial infarction as there were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes .\non 10-27-93 , the patient went to the cath lab which revealed a small nondominant right coronary artery without any lesions , a restenosis of the proximal left anterior descending lesion that had been PTCA 'd , a lesion in the first OM , and a moderately severe left circumflex lesion after the OM3 .\nThe left ventriculogram revealed an akinetic anterolateral and apical ventricle .\nGiven the results of this cardiac catheterization , which were not significantly changed from his previous cardiac catheterization prior to the PTCA , it was elected to attempt to medically manage the patient .\nHe was ambulated progressively on the floor .\nA beta blocker was started with Metoprolol initially at 25 mg PO bid and eventually increased to 50 mg PO bid .\nThe patient ambulated extensively on the FIH 20 floor each day without any episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath .\nOn 11-2-93 , the patient underwent a low level treadmill exercise test with Thallium imaging .\nThis treadmill test was done on medications , including beta blockers , in hopes to assess an amount of ischemia on treatment .\nThe patient was able to exercise for approximately nine minutes on a modified Bruce protocol , however , he did not reach his predicted maximal heart rate while he was on the beta blockade .\nThere were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes during the treadmill exercise test , although he did have 0.5 to 1 mm ST depression in II , III , and AVF .\nThe study was halted for shortness of breath and there was no chest pain .\nThallium images revealed a moderate sized region of ischemic but viable myocardium involving the anteroseptal and lateral segments of the left ventricle .\nThere was also some evidence of left ventricular dysfunction during the test .\nThese images were essentially unchanged compared with the previous Thallium images in May 1993 .\nAfter extensive discussion between myself , Dr. Amesin , and Dr. Scgach , it was elected to discharge the patient to home with medical management .\nThe patient was extremely reluctant to undergo surgery , although he understands that this may become necessary in the future .\nDr. Amesin had a long discussion with the patient 's daughters revolving primarily around issues of the patient 's compliance .\nPreviously he had not taken any of his medicines and smoked heavily on the outside and not kept any of his appointments .\nThe importance of quitting smoking as well as continuing to follow his medical regimen was emphasized to the daughter and to the patient .\nShe will be actively involved in encouraging the patient to comply with this medical regimen and also to follow up with Dr. Amesin as well as Dr. Lfsquarc on the outside .\nThe patient remained guaiac negative throughout the entire hospitalization .\nDespite being on heparin for a short time , his hematocrit remained very stable with only a small dip after the catheterization was done .\nHe will need to be followed up as an out patient for guaiac positive stools and possibly worked up for this in the future .\nCAGHALA UINTEELE , M.D.\nTR :\nyf \/ bmot\nDD

back pain at about 9:30 p.m.\nHe was taken to the Pre Health emergency room and at about 2:45 a.m. on 7\/30 an electrocardiogram demonstrated 3 to 4 mm ST elevations in leads V1 to V4 and 2 mm ST elevations in lead V5 .\nHe was treated with nitroglycerin , antacids and intravenous morphine .\nHe was transferred to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital hemodynamically stable .\nHE arrived in the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital emergency room with a blood pressure of 120\/80 , heart rate 90 .\nAn electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 94 with premature ventricular contractions .\nIt was notable for 4 to 7 mm ST elevations throughout the precordium with Qs in leads V1 and V2 , with 2 mm ST elevations in aVL and 1 to 2 mm reciprocal ST depressions in leads II , III and aVF .\nThe initial physical examination was notable for bright red blood per rectum .\nHe was treated with intravenous nitroglycerin , intravenous morphine , aspirin , Ativan and a LIdocaine drip .\nBecause of the noted bright red blood per rectum , thrombolysis was deferred and the patient was taken immediately to the cardiac catheterization laboratory .\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\nNotable only for surgical repair of an ulcer and a remote appendectomy .\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\nNone\nALLERGIES :\nPenicillin , which gives him a rash .\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\nHis habits include smoking one pack per day for many years and moderate to heavy alcohol use .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\nThe patient was an elderly appearing male in no significant distress .\nHis pulse was 84 and regular , blood pressure 114\/70 .\nThe head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was unremarkable .\nThe neck was supple .\nThe carotids were of normal amplitude without bruits .\nOn cardiac examination he had a nonpalpable left ventricular impulse , a quiet S1 and S2 , no murmurs .\nHe had an audible S3 and a jugular venous pressure of 8 .\nOn lung examination he had rales one third up bilaterally .\nHis abdomen was soft and nontender with no hepatosplenomegaly , no guarding and no rebound .\nOn rectal examination he had bright red blood in the vault without any stool .\nHis extremities were without clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\nLABORATORY DATA :\nThe hematocrit was 44.9 , white blood count 14.3 , platelet count 301,000 , sodium 138 , potassium 3.7 , chloride 102 , CO2 27.4 , BUN 12 , creatinine 1.0 , glucose 147 .\nThe electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 94 , left atrial enlargement , ST elevations in V4 through V6 , I and aVL , consistent with acute anterolateral myocardial infarction with Q waves in V1 to V3 and reciprocal ST depressions in leads II , III and aFV .\nThe chest X-ray showed a normal cardiac and mediastinal silhouette , mild pulmonary edema and an elevated left hemidiaphragm .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nThe patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where hemodynamic measurements included a right atrial pressure of 7 , a right ventricular pressure of 33\/8 , pulmonary artery pressure 29\/16 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 16 .\nHe had a proximal 95% left anterior descending lesion and mild to moderate disease in the first obtuse marginal .\nThe left anterior descending lesion was angioplastied to a 30% residual stenosis .\nAn intra-aortic balloon pump was placed in the left groin prophylactically .\nThe patient was hemodynamically stable throughout and was transferred to the MICU .\nOn hospital day 2 the intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned .\nThe patient was intermittently agitated while on the intra-aortic balloon pump and was treated presumptively for alcohol withdrawal with Serax .\nThe Lidocaine drip was rapidly weaned as well .\nOn the third hospital day the intra-aortic balloon pump was removed .\nThe intravenous nitroglycerin and heparin were weaned off .\nAfter removal of the intra-aortic balloon pump the patient was noticeably less agitated .\nOn the fourth hospital day an attempt was made to transfer the patient to the floor .\nHowever , after a single dose of 25 mg of po metoprolol , the patient 's blood pressure dropped to the 60\/40 range and he was therefore kept in the MICU .\nThe peak CPK level was on the second hospital day and was 5,042 with 26.7% MB fraction .\nOn the fifth hospital day the patient was considered stable for transfer to the floor .\nOnce on the floor the patient had no recurrent chest pain .\nAn echocardiogram was performed on the sixth hospital day which demonstrated an ejection fraction of 44% .\nOn transfer to the medical floor the patient was noted to have guaiac negative stool .\nHe was evaluated by the GI Service who felt that , given the patient 's course , he could undergo flexible sigmoidoscopy electively at some point in the future .\nThe patient underwent exercise stress testing with thallium on the ninth hospital day .\nHe exercised for 7 minutes and 30 seconds , achieving 80% of the maximal heart rate on the modified Bruce protocol .\nHe did not have chest pain .\nThere were ST and T wave abnormalities with 2.5 mm horizontal depressions at the beginning of 3 minutes of exercise , which persisted into recovery .\nThe thallium images showed fixed anterior and septal wall defects without any definite evidence of redistribution .\nBased on this data , on the tenth hospital day the patient underwent repeat cardiac catheterization which demonstrated a patent left anterior descending site , a circumflex lesion after the third obtuse marginal , and a distal posterior descending artery lesion with a tight stenosis and a small vessel .\nThese findings were considered not to be hemodynamically significant and the patient was therefore to be discharged on medical therapy including nitrates and aspirin .\nBecause of his persistently marginal blood pressure at 100\/70 , an ACE inhibitor which was tried briefly and a beta blockers were elected not to be continued .\nThe patient was discharged in stable condition on the eleventh hospital day .\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :\n1. Acute myocardial infarction .\n2.

appeared to have primarily cardiac disease and therefore because of the left main stenosis , it was reasonable to proceed .\nOn June 24 , 1993 , Dr. Lenni Breutzoln performed triple coronary bypass surgery .\nHe placed a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending , single saphenous vein to the posterior descending artery with 170 cc. per minute flow and a single saphenous vein to the circumflex with 140 cc. per minute flow .\nHe weaned easily off cardiopulmonary bypass .\nHe had no hemodynamic difficulties .\nHe was able to wean from the ventilator , but he did have marginal oxygenation throughout .\nHe did revert back to atrial fibrillation .\nHe was extubated within forty eight hours .\nHe was transferred out of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit on June 26 .\nHe reverted back to atrial fibrillation that required Digoxin , and Verapamil to control .\nHe could not be converted back to normal sinus rhythm even with a trial of Quinaglute .\nHe also had anemia and he was seen in consultation by the Nutrition Service .\nHe was advised to have an ideal body weight of 178 pounds , and clearly a 2300 calorie diet was appropriate for him .\nWeight reduction would be important in the long term management of his coronary disease .\nHe was treated with Digoxin and Diuretics along with Ace inhibitors because of his depressed left ventricular function .\nHe was able to ambulate although somewhat slowly because of his rapid atrial fibrillation .\nIt was considered to obtain a pulmonary consultation on a formal basis , but it was then felt that he would do better by healing fully from his surgery , because he really had little in the way of pulmonary complications , despite the history of sleep apnea of an obstructive basis .\nPrimary in his long term management is cardiac rehabilitation with weight reduction .\nHe will be followed closely in 23 Hwy , Hamp by Dr. Laymie Aslinke .\nMAY A , M.D.\nTR :\not \/ bmot\nDD :\n7\/1\/93\nTD :\n07\/02\/93\nCC

sounds were distant .\nHer abdomen showed active bowel sounds , was nontender and she had no pedal edema .\nLABORATORY DATA :\nLaboratory data was notable for hematocrit of 33.5 , white count of 14.7 , platelet count of 270 .\nBUN 112 , creatinine 2.3 , sodium 142 , potassium 4.2 , CO2 23.4 , and chloride 104 .\nA chest x-ray revealed clear lungs on a portable chest x-ray without evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema .\nA KUB showed a large loop of dilated bowel but no free air and a tortuous calcified aorta .\nAn electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with evidence of an old inferior myocardial infarction and right bundle branch block .\nHOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\nThe patient was admitted to Goman 25 where she was hydrated for the presumed diagnosis of pre-renal azotemia .\nA urinalysis was notable for pyuria with 50 to 100 white cells , and the patient was begun on Levofloxacin for presumed polymicrobial urinary tract infection .\nA head CT scan was performed which showed multiple old ischemic infarcts in the right frontal and cerebellar lobes .\nThere was diffuse atrophy and no evidence of recent bleed .\nThe patient was evaluated by the rheumatology service who noted that the patient 's diagnosis was most consistent with rheumatoid arthritis and possibly PMR .\nThe patient had been followed by Dr. Friednantflirt of the Ph University Of Medical Center .\nAt that time she was noted to have undergone bilateral temporal artery biopsies , both of which were negative for temporal arteritis .\nThe recommendation from the rheumatology service was to attempt to decrease her Prednisone to 5 mg PO q.day with an eye on a change in the severity of her shoulder arthritis symptoms .\nOn the third hospital day the patient developed a sudden change in her mental status while taking pills .\nShe was noted to be arousable and responsive and minimally conversation .\nHowever , she was unable to move her right arm or leg .\nHer eyes were deviated to the left and she had a right facial droop .\nThe patient was taken to the emergent CAT scan which revealed no acute bleeding and was felt to be a cerebral vascular occlusion .\nThe patient was evaluated by the Stroke Service , which recommended a lumbar puncture which was performed and did not reveal evidence of meningitis .\nA cardiac ultrasound was performed which revealed an ejection fraction of 50 percent with wall motion abnormalities in the inferior septal and inferior walls involving the apex .\nThere was trace mitral regurgitation .\nMultiple aortic valve leaflets were thickened without stenosis .\nThere was no evidence of an intraventricular thrombus .\nThe patient was initially treated by increasing her aspirin from 81 mg to 325 mg .\nShe was also continued to be hydrated .\nHer blood pressure medications were held to allow increased cerebral perfusion .\nAfter careful discussion with the neurology service , it was felt that the patient was at too great a risk to be started and maintained on anticoagulant therapy and therefore she was treated conservatively .\nThe patient was subsequently evaluated by the speech pathology service , the physical therapy service and the occupational therapy service for evaluation for her recovery from her stroke .\nHer BUN and creatinine continued to decrease with hydration and Zestril was re-initiated and , as her blood pressure allowed , her Isordil was re-initiated and then her Zestril was increased to 10 mg PO q.day .\nDigoxin was discontinued because of her improved left ventricular ejection fraction .\nThe patient did have a steady decrease in her hematocrit to a minimum of 26.2 and received one unit of packed red blood cells with restoration of her hematocrit over 30 .\nHer ferritin was 83 and there was no evidence of guaiac positive stools .\nIt was elected to defer further evaluation of her anemia at this time .\nHowever , if she became more evidently guaiac positive it would be appropriate to evaluate the source of bleeding in her colon and potentially in her esophagus and stomach .\nNevertheless , the patient was switched from aspirin to Plavix 75 mg PO q.day in view of her history of lower GI bleeding .\nMajor consideration toward the end of the patient 's hospitalization was whether or not she would be able to take adequate PO intake to maintain her volume status .\nInitially it was felt that the patient would require gastroscopy .\nHowever , with the assistance of the patient 's granddaughter , the patient was able to increase her po intake with a lot of assistance .\nThe patient 's granddaughter felt that it was likely that her PO intake would improve when she returned home to the nursing home .\nI discussed this with the granddaughter and told her that if her PO intake was inadequate , that gastrostomy tube would be reasonable in the future and that we would be available to assist in this as it became necessary .\nThe patient was evaluated by the GI service who thought that a PEG would be quite feasible and that they would be delighted to do this if it was necessary and the patient and family agreed .\nNevertheless , we have decided to postpone this issue for now and to see how she does when she returns to the nursing home .\nThe patient will be transferred tomorrow to Naplesvillechaelty .\nI will get in touch with Dr. Areas and please do not hesitate to contact me if I can provide any additional information .\nMy direct pager is 935-131-3314 .\nTAMYRCLEO KOTE , M.D.\nTR :\ngqx\nDD :\n07\/27\/1999\nTD :\n07\/27\/1999 7:52

admitted to the Step Down Unit .\nThe patient continued to experience multiple episodes of sustained and nonsustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia .\nIntravenous procainamide was started , which reduced the frequency and the duration of the ventricular tachycardia .\nOn March 11 , the patient underwent an electrophysiology study .\nDuring the study , ventricular tachycardia with a cycle length of 510 milliseconds was reproducibly induced by extra stimuli delivered from the right ventricular apex .\nPace mapping studies had demonstrated that the origin of the tachycardia to be in the

preoperative radiologic studies , including a transcranial Doppler , which revealed moderate to severe right PICA stenosis but no evidence of disease in the vertebrals , proximal basilars , posterior communicating arteries , middle cerebral arteries , anterior cerebral arteries , or ophthalmic systems .\nHe also underwent a preoperative renal scan which showed decreased perfusion bilaterally , and borderline asymmetric renal function , 57% left , 43% right .\nThe renal ultrasound revealed normal kidneys bilaterally with no evidence of hydronephrosis .\nThe impression of the Renal consultant was that the patient 's renal function was likely secondary to mild ischemic acute tubular necrosis and hypoperfusion .\nNo evidence of cholesterol emboli were noted .\nOn 8-27-92 , the patient was

function slowly improved throughout his postoperative course and by the day prior to discharge , his BUN and creatinine were 48 and 1.9 .\nDr. Freiermthalskush felt that this represented an appropriate improvement in the patient 's acute tubular necrosis , and that he was probably approaching his baseline renal function .\nOn the sixth postoperative day , he was transferred out of the
