:\\n512-13-39\\nADMISSION DATE :\\n01/18/2001\\nDISCHARGE DATE :\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis is a 64 year old patient initially admitted to Dr. Riode Area status post an aorto bifemoral bypass in 01/98 with an end to end proximal and to the common femoral bilaterally .\\nThe patient has had recurrent claudication for the last five months and has developed lesions on the first toe which is apparently similar to aparonychia .\\nHe had an angiogram which shows a severe stenosis in the right distal area with a thrombosing right limb of an aorto femoral graft .\\nHe also has an irregular lesion at the profunda femoris origin and with the superficial femoral occluded bilaterally .\\nHe was therefore admitted to the hospital for an ileofemoral bypass .\\nThe patient unfortunately continues to smoke and has greater than a 50 pack year history of smoking and by notes of Dr. Area 's office , this has been discussed at length with him and the implications of the smoking .\\nHe has a history of a deep vein thrombosis and a question of a pulmonary embolism with what is thought to be a non fully documented hypercoagulable state .\\nHe had a left superficial femoral artery interposition graft around 1990 which is non functioning at the present time , most of which was done at the Alconspore Woocawo Medical Center .\\nALLERGIES :\\nThe patient has no known drug allergies .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nHis medications on admission include Coumadin and Levofloxacin .\\nHis Coumadin has been held for two days .\\nHis claudication is equal bilaterally .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination was remarkable for no carotid bruits , a ventral hernia without any masses which was reasonably reducible .\\nHis rectal exam was refused at the time of surgery since apparently it was negative at the Tocon Hospital the previous week .\\nHe has a first and fourth toe which had some purulent discharge around the toes with ischemic modeled toes and on the left side there were no lesions in the feet .\\nHis pulse exam was a femoral pulse bilaterally , but none distally .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nHis BUN and creatinine were within normal limits at 16 and 1.3 and his hematocrit was 44 with a white blood count of 10,000 and 139,000 platelet count .\\nHe has ankle brachial indices of .36 bilaterally but with his right toes appearing ischemic with lesions he would most likely not heal these lesions .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nDr. Area had asked me to see the patient and after discussing with the patient it was agreed that I would proceed with revascularization of his right leg since he had a angiogram which demonstrated a failing limb of his aortofemoral graft and a tight profundus stenosis .\\nAfter discussing with the patient , getting his prothrombin time closer to range , he was brought to the operating room where a ileo profunda bypass was performed with an 8 mm .\\nEP to FE under general endotracheal anesthesia .\\nThere was copious thrombus in the distal right limb of the aortofemoral graft which also had a thromboendarterectomy performed and excellent inflow was achieved .\\nSuperficial femoral artery was divided since it was also chronically occluded .\\nThere was a significant amount of thrombus at the anastomosis as well which had developed a small aneurysmaltype of dilatation , although there was no dehiscence of the anastomosis .\\nThe profunda had been opened beyond the origin stenosis and the bypass was then performed providing and excellent flow to the calf and excellent pulsevolume recordings were obtained with strong upstrokes .\\nIt was therefore elected not to proceed with a distal bypass graft to the popliteal arteries which would have been required should this not have worked .\\nThe patient postoperatively did quite well .\\nHe had continued good post volume recordings and there was no question that with this improved circulation and Silvadene dressings to his toes that they actually started to heal in his postoperative course with improved perfusion and capillary refill .\\nHis groin incision was healing nicely and he was on Heparin , being converted to Coumadin .\\nBecause of the issue relating to his hypercoagulable state , and the need for getting him in range , he was keptin the hospital and not discharged .\\nThe orders of his wounds and wound care were clarified and he was transferred to Frontera 34 to ensure that this would be performed properly .\\nNo cellulitis was present , and the patient had indicated his desire to be discharged .\\nDespite loading him on Coumadin , his prothrombin time and INR increased slowly and he left the hospital without discharge order or discharge planning on the 18th of December .\\nI had called the patient and discussed with him his care , which he had been then transferring to his local medical doctor for anticoagulation purposes .\\nI explained to the patient that because of his early discharge I would not be able to be responsible for his care but would be happy to see him in theoffice for removal of his sutures and an appointment for that was undertaken .\\nDEGREG R.

carcinoma which was Duke 's grade B-II , lymph nodes were negative .\\nShe received postoperative chemotherapy .\\nIn September of 1992 , she underwent an exploratory laparotomy because of an increased level of CEA in her blood with the presence of a liver abnormality on computerized tomography scan .\\nThe exploratory laparotomy was negative .\\nShe continued to have a rise in her CEA level which prompted a further work up .\\nIn September of 1993 , an abdominal and pelvic computerized tomography scan was negative and in June of 1993 , she had a negative bone scan .\\nIn December of 1994 , a thoracic computerized tomography scan showed a four centimeter soft tissue mass on the left suprahilar region , adjacent to the aortopulmonary window .\\nShe also experienced increased hoarseness over the preceding months , which was due to left vocal cord paralysis .\\nShe also complains of increased shortness of breath for the preceding month and now presents for mediastinal exploration and resection of her probable metastatic mass .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nThe patient has a history of hypertension , coronary artery disease , previous myocardial infarction in 1983 ,

Thallium .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nMetoprolol 50 mg PO bid , Isordil 20 mg PO tid , enteric coated aspirin 1 PO qd .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient is a 65 year old Portuguese male with a history of an anterior myocardial infarction i May 1993 and is status post a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the LAD who presented on 10-24-93 with crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath .\\nHe had no prior cardiac history until May 1993 when on 5-24 he had crushing chest pain which radiated to his left arm .\\nHe was found at that time to have 3-4 mm ST segment elevations in V1 through V4 at Pre Health .\\nThe patient was transferred to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital and had 4-7 mm ST segment elevations across the precordium with Q's in V1 and V2 , 2 mm ST elevation in AVL , and 1-2 mm reciprocal ST depression in II , III , and F.\\nOn physical examination at that time he had bright red blood per rectum and therefore lysis was deferred and he was taken directly to the cardiac catheterization lab .\\nThe cardiac catheterization results at that time revealed a right atrial pressure of 7 , pulmonary artery pressure of 29/16 , RV 33/8 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 16 .\\nHe had a 95% proximal left anterior descending lesion which was PTCA 'd to a residual of 30% and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed .\\nHe also had some mild to moderate disease at the OM1 noted at that time .\\nThe patient was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit where he had a peak CPK of 5,042 and 26.7% MB's .\\nHis intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned without problems .\\nHe had hypotension with beta blockers and therefore they were not started .\\nOn day six , an echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 44% with anterior akinesis and septal hypokinesis .\\nOn day nine , he had a low level exercise tolerance test with Thallium which was positive for 2.5 mm horizontal depressions in II , III , and AVF , and 1.5 mm downsloping ST depressions in V5 and V6 , as well as some anteroseptal redistribution on Thallium .\\nTherefore , he went to repeat cardiac catheterization which revealed that the left anterior descending site was patent and revealed a distal PDA lesion and a circumflex lesion after the OM .\\nThe patient was discharged to home and is supposed to follow up with Dr. Shuffburle of Gastroenterology for work up of his bright red blood per rectum and is supposed to follow up with Dr. Amesin of Cardiology and Dr. Shuffpasc of Dingclearf Alllirefaith Memorial Hospital .\\nHowever , he did not keep any of these appointments .\\nHe went home and did not take any of his medications and smoked and drank heavily throughout the several months .\\nOn the a.m. of 10-24-93 , the patient developed crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath .\\nHe came to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Emergency Ward where he was noted to be ashen and diaphoretic .\\nHe was treated with oxygen , aspirin , five sublingual nitroglycerins , heparin , and was eventually made pain free with that regimen .\\nCARDIAC RISK FACTORS :\\nHis cardiac risk factors included hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , cigarette smoking , and a positive family history .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nHis past medical history included hypertension and non-insulin diabetes mellitus which is diet controlled .\\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY :\\nHis past surgical history had included gastric ulcer surgery and appendectomy .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nOn admission , he was on Isordil 10 tid and enteric coated aspirin , but he was not taking either of these medications .\\nHABITS :\\nThe patient smokes one pack per day and has a history of heavy alcohol use .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nThe physical examination on admission revealed a blood pressure of 110/70 , a heart rate of 66 , respirations of 24 , temperature of 98 .\\nThe HEENT exam revealed the extra ocular movements intact

lymphadenopathy and no jugular venous distention .\\nThe carotids were 1+ without bruits .\\nThe heart was regular rate and rhythm , S4 , S1 , S2 , with a I / VI systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border .\\nThe lungs were clear , except for a few dry crackles bibasilarly .\\nThe abdomen revealed a midline scar and a right lower quadrant scar , and it was soft and nontender wit positive bowel sounds .\\nThe liver edge was 2 cm below the right costal margin , but smooth and nontender .\\nThere was no splenomegaly .\\nThe femoral pulses were diminished .\\nHe had bilateral intertrigo in his femoral region as well as his axillae .\\nThe extremities revealed no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\\nThe pulses were 1+ bilaterally .\\nThe skin exam revealed changes consistent with vitiligo .\\nThe rectal examination was guaiac negative .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe laboratory data revealed normal electrolytes , BUN and creatinine , normal liver function tests , a first CPK of 140 , and a hematocrit of 43.1 .\\nThe portable chest X-ray showed clear lungs , slight enlarged heart , and a mildly elevated hemidiaphragm .\\nThe electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at 81 , with normal intervals and normal axis , had poor R-wave progression consistent with an old anterior myocardial infarction , had flipped T-waves in V1 through V5 , which were of no significant change since his last EKG on 5-25-93 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to the Step Down Unit for a rule out MI protocol .\\nHe was treated with aspirin , heparin , and intravenous nitroglycerin .\\nNo beta blockers was started because of his history of hypertension with beta blockers and because his blood pressure of only 110/70 .\\nThe patient ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak CPK of 219 and 20.9% MB fraction .\\nThis was a non-Q wave myocardial infarction as there were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes .\\non 10-27-93 , the patient went to the cath lab which revealed a small nondominant right coronary artery without any lesions , a restenosis of the proximal left anterior descending lesion that had been PTCA 'd , a lesion in the first OM , and a moderately severe left circumflex lesion after the OM3 .\\nThe left ventriculogram revealed an akinetic anterolateral and apical ventricle .\\nGiven the results of this cardiac catheterization , which were not significantly changed from his previous cardiac catheterization prior to the PTCA , it was elected to attempt to medically manage the patient .\\nHe was ambulated progressively on the floor .\\nA beta blocker was started with Metoprolol initially at 25 mg PO bid and eventually increased to 50 mg PO bid .\\nThe patient ambulated extensively on the FIH 20 floor each day without any episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath .\\nOn 11-2-93 , the patient underwent a low level treadmill exercise test with Thallium imaging .\\nThis treadmill test was done on medications , including beta blockers , in hopes to assess an amount of ischemia on treatment .\\nThe patient was able to exercise for approximately nine minutes on a modified Bruce protocol , however , he did not reach his predicted maximal heart rate while he was on the beta blockade .\\nThere were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes during the treadmill exercise test , although he did have 0.5 to 1 mm ST depression in II , III , and AVF .\\nThe study was halted for shortness of breath and there was no chest pain .\\nThallium images revealed a moderate sized region of ischemic but viable myocardium involving the anteroseptal and lateral segments of the left ventricle .\\nThere was also some evidence of left ventricular dysfunction during the test .\\nThese images were essentially unchanged compared with the previous Thallium images in May 1993 .\\nAfter extensive discussion between myself , Dr. Amesin , and Dr. Scgach , it was elected to discharge the patient to home with medical management .\\nThe patient was extremely reluctant to undergo surgery , although he understands that this may become necessary in the future .\\nDr. Amesin had a long discussion with the patient 's daughters revolving primarily around issues of the patient 's compliance .\\nPreviously he had not taken any of his medicines and smoked heavily on the outside and not kept any of his appointments .\\nThe importance of quitting smoking as well as continuing to follow his medical regimen was emphasized to the daughter and to the patient .\\nShe will be actively involved in encouraging the patient to comply with this medical regimen and also to follow up with Dr. Amesin as well as Dr. Lfsquarc on the outside .\\nThe patient remained guaiac negative throughout the entire hospitalization .\\nDespite being on heparin for a short time , his hematocrit remained very stable with only a small dip after the catheterization was done .\\nHe will need to be followed up as an out patient for guaiac positive stools and possibly worked up for this in the future .\\nCAGHALA UINTEELE , M.D.\\nTR :\\nyf / bmot\\nDD :\\n11-3-93\\nTD :\\n11/04/93\\nCC :\\nDr. Telshey Swatlleebtik Dr. Eri Lfsquarc\\n[ report_end

male who reports a pattern of intermittent chest pain during the week prior to admission .\\nOn the night prior to admission he was awakened from sleep with severe substernal chest pain radiating to the left arm , accompanied by back pain at about 9:30 p.m.\\nHe was taken to the Pre Health emergency room and at about 2:45 a.m. on 7/30 an electrocardiogram demonstrated 3 to 4 mm ST elevations in leads V1 to V4 and 2 mm ST elevations in lead V5 .\\nHe was treated with nitroglycerin , antacids and intravenous morphine .\\nHe was transferred to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital hemodynamically stable .\\nHE arrived in the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital emergency room with a blood pressure of 120/80 , heart rate 90 .\\nAn electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 94 with premature ventricular contractions .\\nIt was notable for 4 to 7 mm ST elevations throughout the precordium with Qs in leads V1 and V2 , with 2 mm ST elevations in aVL and 1 to 2 mm reciprocal ST depressions in leads II , III and aVF .\\nThe initial physical examination was notable for bright red blood per rectum .\\nHe was treated with intravenous nitroglycerin , intravenous morphine , aspirin , Ativan and a LIdocaine drip .\\nBecause of the noted bright red blood per rectum , thrombolysis was deferred and the patient was taken immediately to the cardiac catheterization laboratory .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nNotable only for surgical repair of an ulcer and a remote appendectomy .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nNone\\nALLERGIES :\\nPenicillin , which gives him a rash .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nHis

mediastinal silhouette , mild pulmonary edema and an elevated left hemidiaphragm .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where hemodynamic measurements included a right atrial pressure of 7 , a right ventricular pressure of 33/8 , pulmonary artery pressure 29/16 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 16 .\\nHe had a proximal 95% left anterior descending lesion and mild to moderate disease in the first obtuse marginal .\\nThe left anterior descending lesion was angioplastied to a 30% residual stenosis .\\nAn intra-aortic balloon pump was placed in the left groin prophylactically .\\nThe patient was hemodynamically stable throughout and was transferred to the MICU .\\nOn hospital day 2 the intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned .\\nThe

third hospital day the intra-aortic balloon pump was removed .\\nThe intravenous nitroglycerin and heparin were weaned off .\\nAfter removal of the intra-aortic balloon pump the patient was noticeably less agitated .\\nOn the fourth hospital day an attempt was made to transfer the patient to the floor .\\nHowever , after a single dose of 25 mg of po metoprolol , the patient 's blood pressure dropped to the 60/40 range and he was therefore kept in the MICU .\\nThe peak CPK level was on the second hospital day and was 5,042 with 26.7% MB fraction .\\nOn the fifth hospital day the patient was considered stable for transfer to the floor .\\nOnce on the floor the patient had no recurrent chest pain .\\nAn echocardiogram was performed on the sixth hospital day which demonstrated an ejection fraction of 44% .\\nOn transfer to the medical floor the patient was noted to have guaiac negative stool .\\nHe was evaluated by the GI Service who felt that , given the patient 's course , he could undergo flexible sigmoidoscopy electively at some point in the future .\\nThe patient underwent exercise stress testing with thallium on the ninth hospital day .\\nHe exercised for 7 minutes and 30 seconds , achieving 80% of the maximal heart rate on the modified Bruce protocol .\\nHe did not have chest pain .\\nThere were ST and T wave abnormalities with 2.5 mm horizontal depressions at the beginning of 3 minutes of exercise , which persisted into recovery .\\nThe thallium images showed fixed anterior and septal wall defects without any definite evidence of redistribution .\\nBased on this data , on the tenth hospital day the patient underwent repeat cardiac catheterization which demonstrated a patent left anterior descending site , a circumflex lesion after the third obtuse marginal , and a distal posterior descending artery lesion with a tight stenosis and a small vessel .\\nThese findings were considered not to be hemodynamically significant and the patient was therefore to be discharged on medical therapy including nitrates and aspirin .\\nBecause of his persistently marginal blood pressure at 100/70 , an ACE inhibitor which was tried briefly and a beta blockers were elected not to be continued .\\nThe patient was discharged in stable condition on the eleventh hospital day .\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :\\n1.

kept NPO until January 26 when she began to feel hungry .\\nAt that time clear liquids were started .\\nAll of her stools were guaiaced .\\nShe also began Nadolol 40 mg QD to reduce her portal hypertension .\\nThe GI consult team continued to follow her .\\nWe also tried to contact her physician at Va Sit Namar Healthcare and was unsuccessful .\\nTherefore we decided to work up her cirrhosis .\\nShe was described as having _______ cirrhosis and we decided that we wanted to try to figure out the etiology .\\nHer ferritin and iron studies did not reveal any evidence of hemochromatosis and her hep serologies were all negative .\\nShe also had negative antimitochondrial antibody and she also had no evidence of ceruloplasmin .\\nOver the course of her admission were also sent an alpha-1-antitrypsin , which was negative .\\nShe did very well over the course of her admission with no evidence of further bleeding .\\nHer hematocrit stayed stable at approximately 32 .\\nWe also did an ultrasound guided paracentesis .\\nThe peritoneal fluid showed a glucose of 244 , total protein 0.8 and a albumin of 0.5 , globulin 0.3 , amylase 16 , LDH of 51 .\\nThe serum albumin gradient was 1.8 consistent with portal hypertension .\\nThe cell count showed a white blood cell count of 160 with 16% polys .\\nShe therefore _________ criteria for a spontaneous bacterial peritonitis .\\nHer platelet count stayed persistently low and we decided that it might be due to Cimetidine .\\nTherefore we switched her Cimetidine to Prilosec .\\nBy the 2th the patient was feeling very well and desired to transfer or discharge to home .\\nShe wanted to be closer to North Dakota .\\nAfter discussion with her private physician , Dr. Joasscchird , tel. 090-249-6079 , at Va Sit Namar Healthcare and Dr. Acrookesjo at Do Of Hospital , the patient was judged to be fit for discharge and she was sent home with AH and physical therapy .\\nShe was quite able to climb stairs on her own in the hospital .\\nShe is to follow up with Dr. Acrookesjo in one week and Dr. Work the gastrointestinal fellow here at PUOMC in 2 weeks .\\nShe may require a repeat upper endoscopy study to see if she needs any rebanding .\\nThe patient however complained of a persistent wheeze with beta blocker , therefore it was agreed that we would stop the beta blocker until the patient was followed up as an outpatient .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nZoloft 50 mg PO QD , Lactulose 15 g PO BID , Synthroid 0.15 mg PO QD , Prilosec 20 mg PO BID .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nGood .\\nLENTNY WORK ,

96 .\\nOtherwise , the SMA 20 was within normal limits .\\nWhite count was 5.5 , hematocrit was 43.5 , and MCV was 9l .\\nPlatelet count was 350,000 .\\nDifferential included 66 polys , 24 lymphocytes , 3 monocytes , and l eosinophil .\\nPT was l3.l and PTT was 30.9 .\\nUrinalysis revealed a specific gravity of l.0l5 , a pH of 8.0 , l+ ketones , and no blood .\\nChest X-Ray showed hyperinflation bilaterally and loss of the anterior clear space on the lateral film likely secondary to arm position since the patient was unable to raise up her arm from weakness stemming from her multiple sclerosis .\\nEKG showed baseline artifacts , sinus tachycardia at l05 , PR interval of 0.l6 , QRS of 0.08 , QT of 0.36 , an axis of 60 degrees , poor R wave progression with transition after the V4 lead , T wave flattening in II and F , and T wave inversion in III .\\nNo old EKG was available for comparison .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\n1) Multiple sclerosis - The patient underwent lumbar puncture which revealed a glucose of 73 , a protein of 38 , positive oligoclonal bands with an IgG to albumin ratio of 0.485 .\\nCell count was l white cell and 5l red cells with a differential of 90 lymphocytes and l0 monocytes in tube number four and two white cells and 600 red cells with a differential of 5 polys , 90 lymphocytes , and 5 monocytes in tube number one .\\nPatient also had an MRI scan of the head which showed a lesion in the left pons consistent with multiple sclerosis .\\nSerum IgG was elevated at l,520 .\\nSPEP showed an elevated gamma spike of l.83 and was otherwise within normal limits .\\nThe patient underwent Lenti Pidesrah Non Community Hospital multiple sclerosis treatment , group II protocol with Cytoxan and ACTH induction with the plan for maintenance Methylprednisolone after discharge .\\nShe tolerated the protocol medications well except for some nausea and vomiting which was relatively well controlled with anti-emetic medication and also some very mild hematuria to the tune of 20 to 25 red blood cells on micro .\\nThis was , in fact , consistent with the fact that she had an indwelling Foley placed on admission after post-void residual was noted to be 200 cc of urine .\\nShe received Occupational Therapy and Physical Therapy during the hospitalization .\\n2) Anemia - Patient had a steady drop in hematocrit from the admission value of 43.5 to the range of about 3l by hospital day number eight which remained stable at this point .\\nShe had guaiac negative stools , no menses , no significant hematuria , and no signs of hemolysis .\\nWork-up included an iron of l24 , TIBC of 207 , a ferritin of l24 , and Bl2 and folate were pending but unlikely to be contributing to this acute drop .\\nHaptoglobin was l79 with a normal bilirubin and a normal LDH .\\nGlucose was 6 , phosphate deficiency was checked with a normal level of 25 being measured , and reticulocyte count of less than 0.l% was noted at one point with follow-up reticulocyte count of 0.l% noted on the day prior to discharge .\\nThis was felt to be consistent with decreased bone marrow production of new red cells and possibly a hematocrit drop secondary to in-hospital phlebotomy with some dilutional component secondary to intravenous and p.o. hydration .\\nPatient did not show coincident decrease in white count or platelet count .\\nA clot was sent to the Blood Bank , however , the patient did not require a transfusion .\\nShe did receive Bactrim for a urinary tract infection and this medication was discontinued given its potential for aplasia in the bone marrow .\\nPatient will be followed up with subsequent CBC on the September , the September , the September , and the Septemberth of 2006 to assure that her hematocrit recovers .\\n3) Urinary tract infection - Patient had too numerous to count white cells on urinalysis on 08/15/90 and was thus begun on Bactrim DS one tablet p.o. b.i.d.\\nSubsequently , urine culture prior to initiation of antibiotic therapy grew out pan sensitive E. coli , greater than l00,000 including sensitivities to Bactrim .\\nPatient received a seven day course of Bactrim DS one tablet b.i.d. with resolution of symptoms and subsequent negative culture .\\nHer Foley will be discontinued at discharge and she will continue home straight catheterizations given her post-void residual of 200 cc on admission per the visiting nurse .\\nDISPOSITION :\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\\nMultivitamins one tablet p.o. q.d. , Halcion 0.l25 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. ( forty tablets , no refills ) , and Acthar 40 units intramuscularly q.d. times two days and then 20 units intramuscularly q.d. times three days .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable .\\nDisposition is to home .\\nFollow-up care will be per Dr. Critche at the Cockdownbayscot Waredoun Inmountsonente Memorial and per Dr. A Or at the Retelk County Medical Center with regard to the Rys Memorial Hospital protocol .\\n________________________________\\nMJ092/0660 A L.

embolic cerebrovascular accident which presented with confusion in an right homonymous hemianopsia .\\nHe was taken to the Intensive Care Unit .\\nA follow-up MRI showed low attenuation lesions in both occipital lobes consistent with embolic stroke .\\nHe was treated with aspirin .\\nNovember 19 , 1997 , he underwent a resection of a skull base chordoma and a lateral mandibulotomy with tracheostomy .\\nPostoperatively he had a right true vocal cord paralysis with evidence of aspiration and he therefore received Gelfoam insertion injection into the vocal cord and a PEG was preformed .\\nHe was discharged home with at follow-up MRI and on December 25 , 1997 again revealed a large ill defined lobulated skull based mass with a mass effect on the medulla .\\nNow preoperatively he reports occasional sharp pains in his right jaw that last about five seconds then resolves as well as loss of his right peripheral vision , difficulty swallowing .\\nHe is taking some liquids p.o. but also has G-tube feedings q.2h.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nStatus post tonsillectomy , status post appendectomy , status post lumbar fusion remote .\\nDIET :\\nJevity Plus one can q.12h. by G-tube ,

craniotomy with microresection of tumor along with a laminectomy .\\nPostoperatively , he was taken to the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit where he remained intubated .\\nHe was extubated on postoperative day number one .\\nHis neurological examination remained unchanged with continued right tongue deviation and lack of gag reflex .\\nHe was transferred to the floor on postoperative day number two and he was ambulating .\\nHe was seen by Physical Therapy who noted that he had problems with balancing and he used a rolling walker .\\nHe noticed some nose dripping on postoperative day number four however in the next several days there was no evidence of this cerebrospinal fluid leak as he denied any further nose dripping however he was placed on antibiotics to cover a possible cerebrospinal fluid leak .\\nOn postoperative day number eight he again reported leaking from the right nostril .\\nHe vomited once and had intermittent headaches .\\nA head CT was done to evaluate a possible hydrocephalus , no hydrocephalus was seen where there was an old infarct in the right frontal lobe white matter and the occipital region with a pseudomeningocele , status post resection of the right skull based tumor extending to the C2 level .\\nA lumbar drain was placed and for the next five days 50 cc was drained every eight hours .\\nA culture taken from the lumbar drain showed Staphylococcus aureus resistant to the Nafcillin which he was receiving and he was therefore placed on Vancomycin .\\nHe was also receiving Ofloxacin for a presumed aspiration pneumonia and a Staphylococcus aureus from his cerebrospinal fluid was sensitive to both Vancomycin and Ofloxacin .\\nHe was followed by the Speech Pathology Team who noted that he still had evidence of aspiration .\\nA video swallow was done which showed moderately severe oral pharyngeal dysphasia with premature spill over and laryngeal penetration with aspiration of some liquids .\\nBecause of continuing complaints by Mr. Marker about nausea with his tube feedings and concern with his aspiration the G-tube feedings were not ideal .\\nHe underwent a conversion of his gastrostomy tube to an transgastrojejunostomy tube by the Interventional Radiologist on Feb 04 , 1997 .\\nPrior to admission Mr. Marker had been taking one can of Jevity every two hours as a bolus .\\nAfter conversion to a jejunostomy tube one would normally use continuous feedings , however Mr. Marker did not want to use continuous feedings , he prefers the boluses which would not require him to be attached to a feeding tube .\\nIt was explained to him that this can result in diarrhea but he has elected to continue bolus feedings .\\nHis visiting nurse will be instructed to observe for diarrhea and if problems develop a home jejunostomy feeding tube apparatus will be obtained .\\nHis lumbar drain was removed after five days .\\nHe was observed overnight and there is no current evidence of cerebrospinal fluid leak .\\nHe is therefore being discharged on postoperative day number fifteen .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\n1) Ofloxacin 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. for one week .\\n2) Jevity Plus one can q.2h.\\nHe will have visiting nurse and home Physical Therapy services .\\nFOLLOW-UP :\\nFollow-up will be with Dr. Sick in one weeks time .\\nHe will needed a follow-up CT or MRI for the pseudomeningocele .\\nADDENDUM\\nMr. Marker will be restarted on his preoperative Aspirin as he is now far enough out from his surgery .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\n1) Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.\\n2)

:\\n04/02/1991\\nReport Status :\\nUnsigned\\nDischarge Date :\\n04/09/1991\\nCHIEF COMPLAINT :\\nEPIGLOTTITIS .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis is an 87 year old white female who is otherwise healthy by history and presented with a several day history of upper respiratory infection .\\nOf note , the patient does not smoke and does not drink .\\nShe was seen by her local internist after having several days of blood-tinged sputum which she was coughing up and some mild throat discomfort .\\nShe did not complain of significant pain and was able to tolerate p.o.s.\\nShe denied any respiratory distress although her family thought she may have had some labored breathing at one point .\\nShe was seen by her local physician who was concerned that she may have a malignancy secondary to the history of hemoptysis and throat discomfort .\\nHe recommended that she see a local otolaryngologist .\\nExamination by the local otolaryngologist appareantly revealed significant swelling in the epiglottic area although we had no true record of what was seen .\\nThere was also a question of a carcinomatous lesion on the left side of the epiglottis .\\nApparently the findings were significant enough to cause this otolaryngologist to recommend that the family bring the patient emergently to Ez Ephtro Health Center where she be admitted for steroids and antibiotics and apparently the question of a tracheostomy was raised .\\nThe patient 's granddaughter , however , works at Retelk County Medical Center and therefore the family elected to bring the patient home and then bring her to Retelk County Medical Center .\\nShe presented to the Emergency Room with some throat discomfort , some mild hoarseness , which she said had been progressing over the last few days .\\nShe was sitting straight upright although was not having any respiratory distress .\\nShe did report a lot of salive in the back of her throat .\\nShe was febrile to 101.7 .\\nENT consult was obtained .\\nA lateral neck film revealed significant swelling of the epiglottis .\\nENT examination was then to be performed .\\nChest x-ray showed significant kiphosis but otherwise no significant lesions at all .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nNegative .\\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY :\\nNegative .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMIT :\\nNone .\\nALLERGIES :\\nNone .\\nSmoking none .\\nFAMILY HISTORY :\\nNegative .\\nAlcohol none .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nLives in an old age facility but is quite active and quite independent .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nThe patient was sitting upright and was not drooling and was able to swallow her secretions although she did have a very wet voice which got progressively more hoarse during the examination .\\nShe had no respiratory distress but did choose to sit in an upright position .\\nHer ear examination was normal .\\nNasal examination was normal .\\nOral cavity was normal .\\nNeck :\\nRevealed fullness in the submental and suprahyoid regions with mild tenderness which was consistent with edema of the soft tissues without significant mass .\\nNeck :\\nOtherwise normal and the trachea was midline .\\nHypopharyngeal examiantion revealed a severely edematous , yellowish-white epiglottis with significantly edematous base of tongue which had marked watery edema .\\nThe left pyriform was obliterated by edema .\\nThe right pyriform was narrowed by edema .\\nThe epiglottis was so edematous that is was pushed back posteriorly and abutted the posterior oropharynx completely obscuring the larynx .\\nThe patient had no stridor and it was clear that she must be breathing around the epiglottis .\\nThere was blood oozing out from the left lateral epiglottis at the region consistent with its base although this was unclear for identification secondary to edema and it was possible that she may have had a lesion in this area .\\nLungs :\\nClear .\\nHeart :\\nRegular rate and rhythm .\\nS1 and S2 , no murmurs , rubs or gallops .\\nAbdomen :\\nSoft , nontender , positive bowel sounds , no hepatosplenomegaly , no bruits .\\nNo masses .\\nExtremities :\\nNormal .\\nBack :\\nShowed significant thoracic kiphosis .\\nLABORATORY EXAMINATION :\\nRevealed a WBC count of 11.6 , H and H of 10.7 and 31.7 , platelet count of 268 , differential 94 polys , 0 bands , 5 lymphs , one mono .\\nAs noted above , lateral neck film revealed marked edema of the epiglottis .\\nThe chest x-ray showed signficant kiphosis with several areas of increased interstitial markings but otherwise negative .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was felt to have epiglottitis , possibly secondary to a malignancy , especially in her age group .\\nShe was started on IV Ceftriaxone two grams and was given humidification .\\nDue to the marked amount of edema , it was felt that she should go the Operating Room emergently for elective intubation .\\nShe was taken to the Operating Room at approximately 2:00 a.m. which was approximately one hour after being evaluated by ENT and was intubated awake over a fiberoptic bronchoscope through the left nares with nasal anesthetic only with a #6 endotracheal tube .\\nThe patient was sedated .\\nDirect laryngoscopy was performed but this revealed only a large amount of base of tongue edema with minimally visible epiglottis which was also significantly edematous and no distinct mass or lesion could be noted .\\nShe was transferred to the SICU where she was kept sedated and was given Ceftriaxone one gram q. 12 h. as well as IV steroids for the first 24 hours consisting of Decadron 8 mg q. 8 h. X 3 doses in addition to 10 mg that she received in the Emergency Room on the way down to the Operating Room .\\nHer initial hospital course while intubated was significant for an episode of atrial fibrillation which she went into in the Operating Room .\\nAt the end of the case she had had a central line placed also for frequent blood draws at the request of the SICU house office .\\nHer episode of atrial fibrillation as we planned to take her from the Operating Room after both the intubation and central line placement had been completed .\\nShe had no trouble with blood pressure with this atrial fibrillation with rates going up to 150 .\\nShe was given a dose of Digoxin but broke spontaneously approximately two minutes after the Digoxin was given .\\nEKG and enzymes were obtained and showed the first degree AV block that she had had on her preoperative EKG but no other findings at all .\\nShe continued in normal sinus rhythm and was transferred to the ICU where she was monitored .\\nHer blood gases and O2 saturations correlated well and we used O2 saturations to follow her as well as venous gases and she continued to maintain good O2 saturation .\\nShe was kept ventilated because she was kept sedated .\\nShe went into an SVT the afternoon after intubation and a decision was made to Digitalize her , keeping her level between approximately .6 and 1 .\\nShe continued in sinus rhythm after this episode of SVT and again had no problems with her blood pressure during that .\\nHer edema decreased over the next two days and repeat fiberoptic examination on both 4/3 and 4/4 revealed decreasing edema .\\nOn 4/5/91 in the ICU under controlled conditions , she was electively extubated and had no problems .\\nShe was kept on Ceftriaxone but no further steroids were given .\\nExamination at that time revealed question of a lesion at the left lateral glossoepiglottic fold .\\nOtherwise her examination was normal with good visualization of the larynx and significant decrease in size of the epiglottis .\\nOf note , during her first hospital day when she received steroids her blood sugars did increase significantly and therefore she was started on insulin .\\nOnce the steroids were stopped , the insulin was able to be stopped .\\nTube feedings were started on 4/3/91 and the NG tube was discontinued on 4/5/91 prior to extubation to give a better look at the epiglottis prior to extubating her .\\nAfter extubation she was watched in the ICU for 24 hours and she did well except for some episodes of confusion happening the night of extubation and also the next morning .\\nAgain , MI was ruled out and metabolic tests were within normal limits .\\nO2 saturations looked good .\\nIt was felt that this was a mild episode of ICU psychosis .\\nShe was followed on the regular floor 24 hours after extubation and had no further problems with her airway .\\nShe was maintained on Ceftriaxone and then switched to Augmentin and remained afebrile .\\nHer white counts came down .\\nBlood cultures which had been drawn at the time of intubation were negative .\\nShe had a geriatric consult due to her confusion and they suggested as we had already done to stop all sedatives and sleeping medications .\\nCardiology was contacted and recommended that given her history she should be taken off all Digoxin and just watched and that her SVTs may have been just secondary to stress of intubation .\\nUnfortunately the episodes of atrial fibrillation and SVT were apparently not documented well enough in terms of EKG strips to aid Cardiology and therefore , they gave us an informal consult so that no formal consult will be found in this chart .\\nNonetheless , their input was greatly appreciated and she was taken off of Digoxin and had no further problems with her heart .\\nHer mental status began to clear under the family 's request .\\nDISPOSITION :\\nOn 4/9/91 she was sent home on a week of Augmentin and will followup in the ENT Clinic .\\nOur plan will be to establish whether or not she truly had an epiglottic lesion .\\nShe , of note , had no history of foreign body ingestion or any abrasion or trauma to this area .\\nIf she does have a lesion , then we may entertain , given her age , the possibility of radiating this lesion as opposed to putting her through laryngectomy .\\nDischarge medications are Augmentin 500 mg t.i.d. X 7 days .\\nThe patient is to followup in the ENT Clinic in approximately one week .\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :\\nEPIGLOTTITIS , QUESTION SECONDARY TO EPIGLOTTIC MALIGNANCY .\\nRG556/4903 EENTO WORKS , M.D. NL6\\nD :\\n04/10/91\\nBatch :\\n5391\\nReport :\\nU5989C79\\nT :\\n04/10/91\\nDicatated By :\\nSA JESCWIERST , M.D.\\n[ report_end ]\\n</TEXT>\", \"<TEXT>\\n378274921\\nPUOMC\\n0641514\\n28078/70a4\\n712822\\n5/1/1994 12:00:00 AM\\nGASTRIC OUTLET OBSTRUCTION .\\nUnsigned\\nDIS\\nReport Status :\\nUnsigned\\nADMISSION DATE :\\n05-01-94\\nDISCHARGE DATE :\\n05-22-94\\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\\nGastric outlet obstruction .\\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\\n1.

distention .\\nShe reported that she was remarkably healthy until the latter part of 12/93 , when her granddaughter noticed her to be jaundiced .\\nSince that time she had yellow colored stools .\\nOn 01/24 she was taken to the Rys Memorial Hospital hospital , where she was diagnosed with choledocholithiasis .\\nAn ERCP showed stones in the common bile duct but they could not be recovered .\\nTherefore she was transferred to Ph University Of Medical Center and admitted there from 01/25 - 02/03 .\\nAn ERCP was repeated and it was noted that she had a severely dilated common bile duct which contained stones .\\nThe distal portion of the duct was narrowed and a papillotomy was performed , which drained pus from the common bile duct .\\nThe stones were then removed .\\nThe distal narrowing was dilated and cytology was sent , revealing markedly atypical cells with inflammation .\\nShe was discharged home .\\nApproximately one month prior to admission she developed anorexia , increased abdominal girth , weight loss of 15 lb , and nausea and vomiting .\\nShe presented to the emergency room , where a nasogastric tube was placed and drained approximately 400 of green-brown , thick fluid .\\nShe was admitted for workup of her symptoms .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nAs above ; appendectomy in 1916 , hysterectomy in 1941 , mastoid surgery in 1970 , shingles of right arm in 1994 .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nAspirin daily .\\nALLERGIES :\\nShe has no known drug allergies .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nThe patient lives with her children in Co Darburg and is quite active

:\\nLarge , approximately 30 cm stomach filled with fluid .\\nChest x-ray :\\nclear lungs .\\nEKG :\\nleft bundle branch block , left anterior descending , normal sinus rhythm at 90 , non-specific ST-T wave changes .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to the hospital for workup of a presumed obstructive process .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by the Gastroenterology service and it was decided that an esophagogastroduodenoscopy would be performed .\\nPrior to this study , however , a CT examination of the abdomen was obtained which showed a mass in the porta causing biliary ductal dilatation proximally and gastric outlet obstruction .\\nOn 05/05 an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed , which showed gastric outlet obstruction , a deformed pylorus and a duodenal mass encasing and obstructing the lumen .\\nIt appeared that there was a large tumor mass obstructing the duodenum and pylorus area , and therefore it was decided that she would benefit from a gastrojejunostomy for drainage of her stomach .\\nThe General Surgery service was involved at this stage , and on 05/08 a posterior gastrojejunostomy with wedge liver biopsy was performed to facilitate gastric drainage .\\nPathology of the liver biopsy revealed metastatic , moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma .\\nThe patient did well postoperatively and had prompt return of bowel function .\\nHowever , on postoperative day #5 it was noticed that she had become acutely jaundiced , and her total bilirubin was found to be 7.2 with a direct bilirubin of 4.9 .\\nIt was obvious that she had now obstructed her biliary tree , as her urine became dark and her stools clay colored .\\nAfter discussion with her family , it was decided that a stent would not be placed for biliary decompression and the patient was confirmed as a do not resuscitate status .\\nThe patient 's subsequent hospital course was fairly uneventful .\\nShe complained of fatigue but had a decent appetite .\\nAs she has an obstructing cancer of the biliary tree and further palliative procedures were deferred , her life expectancy is rather limited .\\nThe best course of action was placement in a nursing facility , as her family was unable to care for her at home .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable .\\nSTA THEN , M.D.\\nDICTATING FOR :\\nLIASUN THEN , M.D.\\nTR :\\ndpi / bmot\\nDD

HISTORY OF OVARIAN CYST RESECTION , 1975 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient is a 49 year old woman with a metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast who is status post high dose chemotherapy with PBSE and CCSS support ending June 1994 .\\nShe was admitted on 1-5-94 for fever , chest wall ulceration , cellulitis and pain control .\\nThe patient first presented in October 1991 with a tender right axillary mass .\\nA mammogram done in November 1990 was negative .\\nHowever , mammography repeated in October 1991 showed bilateral breast masses , suspicious for carcinoma .\\nFine needle aspiration on October 23 , 1991 demonstrated atypical cells which occurred singly and in clusters .\\nStaging evaluation included normal liver function tests , normal blood counts and normal chest x-ray .\\nBone scan showed degenerative joint disease in the shoulders and lumbar spine as well as increased radio chaser uptake in the breast bilaterally .\\nDr. Berca Gachfrum performed a right modified mastectomy and left simple mastectomy on November 4 , 1991 .\\nThe right modified radical mastectomy contained a 5.5 cm poorly differentiated , Grade III out of III infiltrating ductal carcinoma .\\nThe margins were free of tumor , but 10 out of 21 lymph nodes were positive for metastatic carcinoma .\\nFurthermore there was a mass on the right pectoralis muscle which is supposed to be metastatic cancer .\\nThe left simple mastectomy also contained 5.5 cm poorly differentiated infiltrating ductal and intraductal carcinoma with extensive lymphatic vessel invasion .\\nEstrogen receptor was 0% by ERICA .\\nThe patient developed a large hematoma requiring surgical drainage .\\nTherefore she had a Stage III-A adenocarcinoma of the breast .\\nSince she was at high risk for both local and metastatic recurrence of her tumor , she received both systemic chemotherapy and radiation therapy .\\nThe patient was treated with CMSAP , which is Cytoxan , Methotrexate , Leukovoranrescue , 5-FU , Adriamycin and Prednisone for four cycles .\\nThere were no dose reductions for mucositis or myelosuppression .\\nHowever , following cycle 4 , she developed a flu-like illness , followed by fever , nonproductive cough and dyspnea on exertion .\\nABGs showed a pO2 of 79 , pH 7.44 , pO2 33 .\\nChest x-ray showed diffuse interstitial infiltrates .\\nThe differential diagnosis included viral pneumonitis , Mycoplasma , Chlamydia .\\nBasically in December 1993 , she returned to the Hem / Onc Clinic with chest wall nodules which turned out to be tumor recurrences and biopsied .\\nAlthough she had mediastinal recurrence , bone scan , head and liver CT were negative for metastatic disease .\\nShe was thus started on a Protocol of high dose chemotherapy with GCSF and peripheral stem cell support .\\nComplications has mainly included myelosuppression and mucositis .\\nShe also developed Klebsiella UTI after the second cycle of high dose chemotherapy .\\nIt was treated with gent and Cipro .\\nRe-staging done in April 1993 showed a decrease in the pretracheal nodes with question of some lymphangitic spread versus some pneumonitis .\\nIn May 1994 she received her first course of thiotepa and Velban and Methotrexate , which required some red cell transfusions .\\nIn mid May she was admitted for fever and neutropenia and at that time had a UTI with blood clots in the urine .\\nThe patient presents today with complaints of fever and a temperature of 100 .\\nShe has also been having diarrhea since November and her other complaints of admission include confusion , nausea and vomiting .\\nWe will include a very thorough HPI with this dictation that was done by Dr. Wedleung .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nSignificant for metastatic breast cancer , complicated by fever and neutropenia .\\nUTIs , obstruction of the right subclavian vein and right brachial cephalic vein , herpes zoster .\\nStatus post ovarian cyst resection in 1975 .\\nShe had menarche at age 15 .\\nShe used the pill for five years in the past .\\nShe is G 2 , P 2 with spontaneous vaginal deliveries .\\nShe has a history of easy bruis ability .\\nShe is allergic to Augmentin which gives her a rash .\\nMEDICATIONS :\\nMS Contin , MSIR , and Percocet .\\nFAMILY HISTORY :\\nNoncontributory .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nMarried with two children .\\nShe worked as an occupational therapist at a professional center for handicapped children .\\nShe denies tobacco and drug use and drinks ethanol socially .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nA cachectic white female .\\nT 100.1 , P 104 , blood pressure 130/90 , heart rate of 16 , she was sating 95% on room air .\\nHEENT -

Normal .\\nAbdomen - Normal .\\nThere was no HSM .\\nExtremities - Her left arm was very swollen .\\nIt was tested with no voluntary movement except at the finger tips .\\nThere was no edema elsewhere in her extremities , only the left arm .\\nNeuro - The patient was oriented to place , but had difficulty with recent memory .\\nShe also had mild weakness in the left extremities , both upper and lower .\\nCranial nerves II - XII were grossly intact .\\nToes were downgoing .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nOf note - Na 133 , K 4 , WBC 8.82 , hematocrit 35.1 , platelets 229 .\\nPT 13.8 with an INR of 1.3 , PTT 25.5 , total protein was 6.2 , albumin 3.4 , globulin of 2.8 , calcium of 9.1 , phos 2.7 , mag 2.1 , urea 3.7 .\\nALT was elevated at 240 , AST 85 , LDH 305 , alk phos 85 , total bilirubin was 1.3 , direct bili was .8 .\\nCholesterol 188 , triglyceride was 127 .\\nUA - trace protein , trace ketones , positive for bilirubin and nitrogen and also 4 to 6 wbcs with 1+ bacteria .\\nChest x-ray - Showed a left paratracheal adenopathy and small left pleural effusion with no evidence of pneumonia .\\nIn summary , the patient is a 49 year old woman with metastatic breast cell CA , status post chemotherapy with CMSAP and PVSC and XRT who presented with fever , four days of diarrhea , nausea and vomiting and had been on Keflex for an erythema on her left chest wall .\\nThe Keflex was stopped when she developed the diarrhea .\\nWhen she arrived the plan was to go ahead and treat here rythematous induration and possible cellulitis with IV antibiotics .\\nSo she was put on dicloxicillin and we did local wound care with an agent called Santyl , which is a collagenace ondebrided which worked very well for her .\\nAlso at the time of admission we were also considering palliative Taxol chemotherapy , which the patient declined .\\nShe refused the Taxol therapy so that was not done .\\nAnother major issue with this patient was pain control .\\nShe had been in a whole lot of pain from her left arm lesion .\\nSo pain control was a big issue so she was on MS Contin and MSIR at home she thought that clouded her thinking , so we tried different things for pain management .\\nOne of them was to do a subarachnoid neurologic block at C6-C7 interface on 1-6-94 .\\nAfter that the patient had minimal relief of pain .\\nHowever , she declined further blocks , which were offered to her .\\nSo accepted to be on dilaudid p.o. which was started at a dosage of 2-4 meg but since then we have tapered it up .\\nShe is now getting dilaudid 8 mg q2h and in addition she has been on fentanyl patch .\\nShe is now getting 75 micrograms per hour of the fentanyl patch which is changed every 72 hours .\\nWe can go up by 25 mg on the fentanyl patch as needed to control her pain and we can always go up on the dilaudid because she is still in considerable amount of pain .\\nOther things that happened during this admission - we obtained ahead CT for her on the 8th of January because of her clouded thinking and altered mental status , which was probably due to the morphine that she was taking .\\nWe went ahead and got a head CT scanand it showed no enhancing lesions .\\nIn addition her liver transaminases were elevated , we thought about doing further work-up , but that was deferred because the patient wanted to wait on that .\\nThat has been stable .\\nThe patient on January 13 became hyponatremic .\\nHer sodium went down to 121 and before that on admission she was 133 .\\nA renal consult was obtained and their assessment was that this was probably a mixture of hypovolemia as well as SIADH .\\nWe proceeded to do for her hyponatremia - we gave her some fluid and her urine sodium became higher than her serum sodium ; we stopped it .\\nWe had given her some normal saline and then we proceeded to just do fluid restriction .\\nIn addition we gave her a sodium chloride one gram per day and that also helped , so that now at the time of discharge , the patient 's sodium is between 126 and 129 ; prior to that it had gone down to as low 116.\\nSo that has really improved .\\nWe suggest continuing increased salt intake in her diet and also continuing with the fluid restriction of free water intake to one liter per day .\\nOn the 14th of January , the patient developed increased shortness of breath and chest x-ray was taken showed a wedge shaped infiltrate in the right upper lobe which was consistent with Hampton 's hump .\\nAlso a VQ scan obtained the next day showed high probability for PE .\\nSo we proceeded to put her on heparin for anticoagulation and then when she was therapeutic on heparin , we went ahead and started her on coumadin and she is currently on coumadin at 2.5 mg q.h.s.\\nHer INR is 2.3 .\\nWe want her INR to remain between 2 and 3 .\\nSo if it goes much lower than 2 , then we would consider increasing it to perhaps coumadin 2.5 and 5 alternating every other night .\\nHowever , we would leave it at 2.5 for now .\\nOther major issues - As a result of all the things happened and with her hyponatremia and also the other problems , her blood pressure was elevated also .\\nWe put her on nifedipine IR , SL and that was not enough to control her blood pressure which was in the 200s in the systolic , so we had started her on atenolol .\\nSo on discharge she is on atenolol 100 .\\nIf needed to you can give her some nifedipine SL to decrease her blood pressure .\\nThe patient also has significant edema in both arms now and also some mild edema in the lower extremities , so I think that fluid restriction should help with that .\\nShe is also a little dry .\\nThe patient is on oxygen .\\nEver since the pulmonary embolus she has been on oxygen .\\nShe was on 4 liters ; now she is on 5 liters , sating 94 to 96% on 5 liters .\\nWe would like for her to remain on the oxygen as well .\\nThe complications that I have listed include the hyponatremia , pulmonary embolus and also the elevatd blood pressure .\\nDISPOSITION :\\nDischarge medications - Baclofen 10 p.o. t.i.d. , MVI one tablet p.o. q.d. , Mycostatin powder TP q.d. to be applied to the rash in her left groin area , also dilaudid 8 mg p.o. q2h , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. fentanyl patch 75 micrograms per hour topical q72 hours , atenolol 100 mg p.o. q.d.\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nFair .\\nShe remains very weak and will most likely benefit from some physical therapy andshe still has the bilateral edema .\\nShe is to go to the Necsoncardel Medical Center for more chronic care .\\nFollow-up is with Dr. Wedleung in the Hem / Onc in two weeks .\\nThe appointment has already been made .\\nThe patient is very limited in how much she can do right now because of her pain primarily and her difficulty breathing .\\nDictated By :\\nJEABRIHARL FIGEFREIERMFOTHGRENDCAJAQUE , M.D.\\nAttending :\\nLA INEMACISTIN PRONTMANDES , M.D. HD45 SY882/1177\\nBatch :\\n020\\nIndex No.\\nYJQI3J9VU6\\nD :\\n01/25/94\\nT :\\n01/25/94\\n[ report_end ]\\n</TEXT>\", '<TEXT>\\n812367409\\nSH\\n21952193\\n06/19/1991 12:00:00 AM\\nDischarge Summary\\nSigned\\nDIS\\nAdmission Date :\\n06/19/1991\\nReport Status :\\nSigned\\nDischarge Date :\\nIndependence Day\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis .\\nShe is now status post three myocardial infarctions .\\nShe has had progressive deformity and rheumatoid arthritis of her right knee .\\nShe presented at this time for a right total knee replacement .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nAs above .\\nAppendectomy .\\nCholecystectomy .\\nLeft total knee replacement in 1977 .\\nPepticulcer disease .\\nMEDICATIONS :\\nOn admission included Inderal , 40 mgpo q.i.d. ; Aldomet , 250 mg po t.i.d. ; apresoline , 250 mg po t.i.d. ; Nitropaste , one -

.\\nTheyalso had diabetes and hypertension .\\nSister with stomach cancer .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION :\\nThe patient was afebrile .\\nHeart rate was 78 , blood pressure 98/50 , respiratory rate of 32 , satting 91% on four liters .\\nIn general , this is an obese male in mild respiratory distress .\\nNeck was supple with no lymphadenopathy .\\nHEENT - normocephalic / atraumatic , extraocular movements are intact , pupils equal , round and reactive to light and accommodation .\\nChest had diffuse crackles bilaterally halfway up .\\nCoronary - irregular PVCs , S1 , S2 normal , positive systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border radiating throughout .\\nAbdomen was distended , tympanitic , mildly tender epigastrium and right lower quadrant .\\nNo rebound or guarding .\\nExtremities had 2+ bilateral lower extremity edema to knees .\\nNo clubbing or cyanosis .\\nNeurologic examination - alert and oriented x 3 , slurred and slow speech , distractable .\\nCranial

2.3 , albumin 3.4 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\n1. Gastrointestinal .\\nThe patient had an elevated bilirubin on admission with decreased output of biliary drain .\\nThe drain was replaced over the wire , 8-10 by IR , when it was accidentally removed .\\nIncreased flow again .\\nThe patient had signs and symptoms develop of SBP , also with an elevated white count .\\nHe was treated broadly with amp , levo and Flagyl .\\nCultures were negative and onlyon one gram stain did it show rare gram negative rods .\\nThe patient 's abdominal fluid cell counts showed 2400 white blood cells , 500 red cells with 82 polyps , 11 lymphs , 7 monos .\\nClinically , this was consistent with SBP , although unfortunately , fluid was never sent for cytology and a lot of those white cells are most likely due to his cancer .\\nHe underwent abdominal paracentesis approximately two times a week for therapeutic .\\nThis had to be performed by IR because the pocket was too deep to access from the bedside .\\nHe received a two week course of broad spectrum antibiotics and will be maintained on Levofloxacin IV for prophylaxis against SBP .\\n2. Pulmonary .\\nFrom a pulmonary standpoint , he continued to complain of shortness of breath .\\nHis apical pneumothorax from the outside hospital had resolved .\\nChest xray was consistent with pleurodesis .\\nHowever , with persistent abdomen distention , there is likely restrictive deficit and , in addition , after each tap , he at times became hypotensive and with some mild fluid resuscitation decompensated with pulmonary edema , requiring both albumin and Lasix to try to mobilize third space fluids .\\nOn the day of discharge , he is stating approximately 91 to 92% on three to four liters .\\nChest xray is still consistent with volume overload .\\nThe plan will be to continue to try to alternate albumin and Lasix to mobilize his fluid .\\n3. Cardiovascular .\\nHe had episodes of bradycardia without subsequent fall in blood pressure at the beginning of his admission .\\nHe was ruled out for a myocardial infarction .\\nEchocardiogram showed 50% ejection fraction with mild mitral regurgitation .\\nHe did not show any episodes of bradycardia throughout the remainder of his hospital course .\\n4.

Heme .\\nFrom a heme standpoint , he presented anemic and with an elevated PT INR .\\nHe required a few transfusions during his hospital course .\\nHe also required FFP initially to reverse his coagulopathy .\\nHowever , this resolved on its own over the hospital course .\\nHis INR normalized , however , unfortunately , he developed bilateral deep venous thromboses during his hospital course and will be maintained on Lovenox .\\n6. Renal .\\nHe had a creatinine of 4.0 on admission and this decreased down to the mid ones with fluid , currently at 1.7 on discharge .\\nFrom his urinalysis , he has mostly a prerenal state .\\nHowever , he does require diuresis to prevent increased volume overload in his lungs from his hypoalbunemic state .\\nAt the time , Nutrition was following , initially with a low fat , low cholesterol , low sugar diet .\\nHis appetite is decreasing somewhat as his disease process progresses , therefore , we have liberalized his diet for him to take what he wishes .\\n7.

Oncology .\\nThe patient initially came for workup of pancreatic cancer with a questions of palliative chemotherapy .\\nHowever , given his rapid clinical decline , this was deferred and I do not suspect that he will be a candidate for this , as the degree of his decline bodes a poor prognosis for him .\\nHis pain here has been controlled , initially on Oxycontin with morphine for breakthrough pain .\\nAs he becomes progressively more somnolent , this will likely need to be switched to IV pain medications only .\\nDiscussion , at that point in time , should occur with the family about comfort measures and about weaning him from his medications to make him more comfortable .\\nCode status - the patient is a DNR / DNI .\\nThis is an unfortunate case but Mr. Po does have an incredibly supportive family who have been here consistently to visit him and that offers him an important source of comfort .\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\\nTylenol , 650 mg p.o. q 4 prn ; Allopurinol , 100 mg p.o. q.d. ; Peridex mouthwash , 10 ml b.i.d.; cholysteramineresin , 4 grams p.o. q.d. ; clotrimazole , one troche p.o. q.i.d. ; Fentanyl patch , 100 mcg per hour topical q 72 hours ; glipizide , 10 mg p.o. q.d.; Atarax , 25 operating table 50 mg p.o. q 6 to 8 hours prn itching ; regular sliding scale insulin ; KBL mouthwash , 15 ccp .o. q.d. prn mouth discomfort ; Lactulose , 30 ml p.o. q.i.d. that was started on January 30 , for no bowel movements with instructions to continue until bowel movement and then decrease to b.i.d. or q.d. ; Lidocaine , 2% , 10 ml UR q 3 to 4 hours prn for pain around Foley site ; Ativan , 0.25 to 0.5 mg IV q 4 to 6 hours prn anxiety with instructions to use caution .\\nThe patient gets very somnolent with Ativan .\\nMaalox Plus , Extra Strength , 15 cc p.o. q 6 hours prn indigestion ; magnesium sulfate ; sliding scale IV and potassium chloride , sliding scale IV .\\nHe is also on Reglan , 10 mg p.o. q h ; Miracle topical cream to affected area ; also Sarna , topical cream , b.i.d.\\nHe has Nystatin suspension mouthwash , 10 cc swish and swallow q.i.d.

Glaucoma drops .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nblood pressure 118/75 , pulse 88 , respirations 20 , in no acute distress .\\nHead and neck exam was unremarkable , except for the right eye being patched over .\\nLungs were clear .\\nBreasts were unremarkable .\\nBack was nontender .\\nHeart exam :\\nregular rate and rhythm , jugular venous pressure was normal , no carotid bruit was noted ; murmur , rub , gallop , click and ectopy were absent .\\nAbdomen was benign .\\nRectal tone was normal , guaiac negative stool .\\nExtremities :\\nwithout clubbing , cyanosis or edema or stigmata of subacute bacterial endocarditis .\\nNormal pulses were palpated .\\nNeurologic exam :\\nthe patient was alert and oriented x 4 .\\nExtensive mental status testing was normal , except for recalling only one out of three objects at five minutes .\\nThere was a touch an anosognosia .\\nCranial nerve exam :\\nvisual fields were full o.s. , visual acuity was 20/70 o.s.\\nPupil o.s. reacted to light .\\nEOMs with full range of movement , no nystagmus .\\nVIIth cranial nerve :\\ninferior left weak .\\nNo gag was present .\\nOtherwise normal CN 's .\\nDTRs showed a mild decrease in left biceps and brachioradialis reflexes , otherwise normal tone , symmetrical reflexes , downgoing toes .\\nMotor exam :\\n5+ throughout , except left hand intrinsic muscles were 4+ , 3+ in the middle digits .\\nNo atrophy was noted .\\nSensory exam showed some leftsided errors with pinprick and proprioception .\\nCerebellar exam :\\nfinger / to/nose was with mild dysmetria , exaggerated on tracking ; rapid alternating movements normal , heel-to-shin was good with few errors .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nChest xray showed expanded lungs with biapical pulmonary opacities .\\nEKG :\\nleft bundle branch block .\\nUrinalysis was unremarkable .\\nBUN 27 , with a creatinine of .9 , glucose was 182 , but otherwise electrolytes were normal .\\nHer admitting hematocrit was 45% , white count 7,700 , with an MCV of 92 , platelets were normal at 263,000 .\\nAlbumin 2.5 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\n# 1. cerebrovascular accident .\\nThe patient suffered some mild weakness which was attributed to stenosis of the distal right internal carotid artery .\\nThis was determined by head CT , head MRI , head MRA , carotid noninvasive studies , transcranial Dopplers .\\nThe possibility of a cardiac origin was evaluated by echocardiogram and Holter monitor .\\nHer echocardiogram curiously showed a normal left ventricular size and systolic function , a patent foramen ovale , with a trace right to left shunt , as determined by bubble study , trace MR was present .\\nPrevious echoes have shown MVP at the Ona Hospital .\\nHer Holter showed up to 12 beats of SVT , but was otherwise unremarkable .\\nThe patient had a normal B12 , negative syphilis serologies and normal thyroid function during this hospitalization .\\nShe was anticoagulated with heparin and after several days Coumadin was started .\\nHer exact Coumadin dose is undetermined at this point , however it looks like it will be something around 5 mg a day .\\nHer pro time and PTT have normalized at the time of discharge .\\nShe needs to be given 5 mg of Coumadin tonight , 5/22/92 .\\nIn addition heparin should be started to drip on arrival at 400 units an hour .\\nIt is discontinued at the time of transport .\\nThe patient has received physical therapy and occupational therapy and her recovery is near complete .\\nDuring evaluation of her neurologic status , it was determined that for several months prior to admission , the patient has been too unsteady to ambulate .\\nOn our exam she is found to have a significant amount of ataxia , especially in the midline and the exact cause of this is unknown .\\nThere are multiple possible contributions and this is where her need for careful internal medical evaluation has arisen .\\nAt the time we were to embark on this evaluation , the patient 's family strongly requested that she be transferred to the Sas General Hospital .\\nWhat follows is a summary of her medical problems and their possible relationship to her ataxia .\\nHer ataxia is likely due to some cerebellar function , though this is not certain .\\nMoreover her MRI did not show any discrete cerebellar lesions .\\nOur leading theory at this point is that her cerebellar dysfunction relates to perineoplastic syndrome , relating to her history of breast Ca .\\nAs I mentioned above , her evaluation was limited by her cardiologic status at the time .\\nWhile mammogram and CA-15.3 and breast exam are all normal , the idea of a perineoplastic syndrome with or without concomitant breast Ca has reared its head .\\nTwo possible markers are anti-Hu syndrome and anti-Yo antibody .\\nThese tests were sent on the 18th and are pending at the time of discharge .\\nThe results can be obtained by paging me , Do A. Joasscchird , M.D. at 834-364-2251 .\\nI will be happy to furnish the results .\\nThe patient has a history of MI in 1989 .\\nEchocardiogram no longer shows wall motion abnormalities .\\nEKG , when the patient goes out of left bundle branch block transiently shows an anterolateral Q/wave inversion .\\nWe would like to discontinue her Isordil to improve upon some orthostatic hypotension , but we are not certain whether her heart will tolerate this .\\nPersantine thallium is scheduled at this time , but is yet to be performed .\\nThe patient has a history of orthostatic hypotension x many years .\\nIt has been evaluated in the past without success .\\nDuring her hospitalization , we confirmed the presence of this , even when she was hydrated with saline , to a fractional excretion of sodium of 2% .\\nStudies of her autonomic system did not document any dysautonomia .\\nStudies of skin galvanic conduction were normal and her RR interval evaluation was not abnormal .\\nThis is a chronic problem but may be contributing to her current weakness and inability to walk .\\nFlorinef is to be considered , however stopping the Isordil is one goal .\\nThe patient has a history of bronchiectasis from a childhood pneumonia .\\nIn addition there is a distant history of M. kansasaii infection .\\nThis has been evaluated by Dr. Screen at Sas General Hospital and probably relates to her lung xray .\\nCT at the Ona Hospital in 1989 showed similar findings .\\nA chest CT was to be performed and may be yielding .\\nA PPD was placed and is to be read on Saturday , 4 26th .\\nThe left volar forearm has the PPD just proximal to the wrist crease and a candida albicans placed just distal to the antecubital fossa .\\nThe patient has a history of deep venous thrombosis in 1990 , for which she received 6 months of Coumadin .\\nDopplers of her lower extremities were negative on this admission .\\nIt is doubtful that she has chronic PE , but this is one consideration .\\nIt is likely that she has pulmonary hypertension from her lung disease , and so this is a consideration .\\nThe patient had mild hyponatremia during this hospitalization with a sodium as low as 131 .\\nWe think this is likely due to an SIADH as she is euvolemic .\\nThis can be evaluated further and is not a problem at this time .\\nThe patient has glaucoma .\\nHer medications are as listed below .\\nHer ophthalmologist is aware of transfer .\\nHis name is Ettrent Can and he can be reached at 678-233-5033 , b 549 .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nPropanolol 5 mg. p.o. t.i.d.

:\\nincluded Percocet , Tenormin , Xanax , Mevacor and with a history of of Calan , Ornade and Lasix .\\nALLERGIES :\\nThere were no known drug allergies .\\nHABITS :\\ndid not include tobacco or alcohol ingestion .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination on admission the patient was somnolent but conversant , oriented x 1 only .\\nChest was clear .\\nHeart had regular rate and rhythm .\\nNeck was supple without mass or bruits .\\nThe abdomen was soft and nontender .\\nCalves were nontender .\\nOn neuro exam the patient was somnolent but readily arousable to conversation .\\nShe looked at the examiner and carried an appropriate conversation but only for seconds at a time .\\nHer face was strong and symmetric .\\nShe felt pin prick and light touch bilaterally to the face symmetrically .\\nHer extra ocular movements were full without nystagmus .\\nShe sees light only od. which is chronic .\\nShe reads large print os.\\nHer tongue was midline and her palate elevated symmetrically .\\nShe could not maintain her arms long enough to detect drift .\\nShe also lifted both legs and flexes at the knees .\\nHer grip is 5/5 bilaterally .\\nAnkle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion were 5/5 bilaterally .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nOn admission her labs. were notable for a hematocrit of 41.9 , white blood count 11.1 , MCV 87 , sodium 142 , potassium 3.0 , chloride 101 , bicarb. 29.3 , BUN 13 , creatinine 0.9 and sugar 134 .\\nA head CT performed on 01/10/92 revealed no cerebrovascular accident and no evidence of acute blood .\\nMRA / MRI revealed a left internal carotid artery aneurysm about 7 mm. in width .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital where a four vessel cerebral angiogram was performed on 01/13/92 .\\nThis revealed a lobulated aneurysm at the p. comm. origin on the left .\\nThis was a left internal carotid artery aneurysm .\\nThe internal carotid arteries and middle cerebral artery showed irregularity of caliber probably due to atherosclerosis .\\nAfter much discussion , endovascular treatment with GD coils were recommended .\\nThe patient underwent coiling on 01/14/92 .\\nThis showed that 60-70% of the distal aneurysm was obliterated by the coils .\\nOne coil protruded into the lumen of the left internal carotid artery aneurysm .\\nIt was thought that the risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage was low but still substantial from the untreated proximal lobe .\\nAlso the risk of ischemia or infarct from the internal carotid artery coil could lead to thromboembolism .\\nTherefore the lowest overall risk was thought to be a craniotomy to obliterate the aneurysm and possibly remove the protruding coil .\\nTherefore after discussion in detail with Sister Rora Dose , a left pterional craniotomy was performed on 01/15/92 .\\nAt this time it was noted that the left internal carotid artery aneurysm was mostly within the cavernous sinus and the extracavernous portion was extremely atherosclerotic .\\nTherefore no clip was possible and the patient underwent a muslin wrapping of the aneurysm .\\nThe patient postoperatively was able to open her eyes to voice and name .\\nHer pupils were equal and reactive and she was able to localize with the left upper extremity as well as raise the right upper extremity above the bed .\\nHer consciousness as well as her strength improved gradually and the patient was referred for rehabilitation at a chronic care center .\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :\\nsubarachnoid hemorrhage and left internal carotid artery aneurysm .\\nPROCEDURES :\\nOn 01/13/92 four vessel cerebral angiogram .\\n01/14/92 embolization of the left internal carotid artery aneurysm .\\n01/15/92 left pterional craniotomy for left internal carotid artery aneurysm with exploration and muslin wrap of the aneurysm .\\nCOMPLICATIONS :\\nThere were no noted complications .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\ninclude heparin 5000 units sq. b.i.d. , MOM 30 cc. p.o. q. hs.

regurgitation and aortic stenosis who was admitted for diagnostic cardiac catheterization .\\nOver the last four to five months , Mr. Warm has noted a marked decline in functional capacity with nearly daily PND and orthopnea .\\nHe has not experienced recent syncope but did have a syncopal episode in 1 resulting in implantation of a defibrillator .\\nAlthough in the past , he has been somewhat ambivalent with respect to cardiac surgery , given the decline in his functional capacity , he agreed to undergo repeat cardiac catheterization with a view towards defining his candidacy for cardiac surgery .\\nThe patient lives independently with his wife in Connecticut and continues to be less and less active unfortunately .\\nHe has nearly curtailed his trips to a gymnasium for cardiopulmonary exercising .\\nHe does not drink alcohol and does not smoke cigarettes .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION :\\nOn examination , the patient was an extraordinarily pleasant man who appeared his stated age .\\nHis blood pressure was 110/70 .\\nHeart was 82 and regular .\\nRespiratory rate was 16 .\\nHis jugular venous pressure was not elevated and his carotids were 2+ .\\nLungs were notable for adequate air movement with no rales .\\nThe first and second heart sounds were physiologically split and the cardiac impulse was rather diffuse and inferiorly displaced .\\nThere was an S3 gallop at the apex and a 2/6 murmur of mitral regurgitation at the apex which radiated to the axilla .\\nThe abdomen was soft and nontender .\\nThere was no organomegaly but modest hepatojugular reflex .\\nThe extremities were without edema and were warm and well perfused .\\nThe posterior tibialis pulses were intact .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nSodium 140 , potassium 5.0 , BUN 45 , creatinine 1.9 , glucose 90 .\\nAlbumin 3.6 , hematocrit 41 , white count 8.6 , platelets 388 and PT 12.6 seconds .\\nThe chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly and no significant congestion .\\nThe ECG was paced .\\nAn outpatient echocardiogram revealed a left atrium of 45 mms. , an LV of 60 mms. , ejection fraction of 26% , moderate to severe mitral regurgitation by color and spectral Doppler , aortic stenosis with a valve area of .8 cms. squared with a peak gradient of 50 , a mean gradient of 30 , an ejection fraction of 26% with diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis and more severe inferior hypokinesis .\\nThere was mild tricuspid insufficiency , an estimated RV peak systolic pressure of 55 and a mild diffuse hypokinesis of the right ventricle .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to the hospital following uncomplicated cardiac catheterization that revealed a right atrial pressure of 5 , a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 23 , pulmonary artery pressure of 56/22 with a mean of 36 , a cardiac output of 6.1 liters per minute with a cardiac index of 3.8 liters per minute per meter squared .\\nThe aortic valve gradient was approximately 32 mms of Mercury peak with a calculated aortic valve area of 1.1 cms. squared .\\nCoronary angiography revealed occlusion of the dominant right coronary artery in the proximal segment with distal reconstitution via left to right collaterals .\\nLeft ventriculography revealed a dilated , diffusely and severe hypokinetic left ventricle with the anterior basilar wall best perfused and an ejection fraction of 18% .\\nThere was 3+ mitral regurgitation and reflux into the pulmonary veins in the ------ views .\\nIn addition , there was a 60% lesion in the left circumflex artery and only minimal irregularities in the left anterior descending itself .\\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well apart from a small rise in his creatinine to 2.3 which returned to his baseline value of approximately 1.7 to 1.9 at the time of discharge after holding his diuretics and his vasodilator medications .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by Dr. Win Shufffyfe of the Cardiac Surgery Service and after a long discussion with the patient , Dr. Shufffyfe and the patient 's family , it was decided to defer cardiac surgery likely indefinitely and probably permanently given the patient 's age , co-morbidities , lack of probable benefit with relief of his mitral regurgitation , modest aortic stenosis and relatively modest coronary artery disease .\\nWhile in hospital , the patient was seen by Lenni Breutzoln who felt that the incremental benefit from biventricular pacing was likely to be modest .\\nThe patient also underwent a sleep study which revealed evidence for fairly advanced and severe obstructive sleep apnea with multiple hypopneas and apneas , mean duration of which was approximately 30 seconds with one episodes of 68 seconds with a desaturation to 71% .\\nThe patient was fitted with a CPAP apparatus with titration of 8-12 cms. of water as tolerated as an outpatient .\\nIn addition , the patient had oxygen therapy given his prominent desaturation at night .\\nAt the time of discharge , the patient 's vasodilator regimen had been winnowed appreciably and he was discharged with a goal weight of 125 lbs .\\nHe will be followed both by Dr. Warm closely upon return to his son 's home in Connecticut and by Gie Lung of the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Heart Failure Partners Home Care Program .\\nDISCHARGE ORDERS :\\n1.

with a history of restrictive and obstructive lung disease , dilated cardiomyopathy , inferior myocardial infarction , and anterior mediastinal masses admitted with acute onset of pulmonary edema .\\nIn the setting of inadvertently decreasing Lasix from 80 mg. po 40 mg. a day Mr. State had sudden onset dyspnea after approximate day and a half prodrome culminating in severe dyspnea .\\nUpon arrival in the Emergency Room Mr. State 's saturations were in the mid 80s and he was promptly rendered more comfortable with high flow oxygen , morphine , and nitrates and intravenous Lasix .\\nChest

COURSE :\\n1 ) Cardiovascular :\\nThe patient was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction .\\nShe remained on telemetry for greater than 48 hours which demonstrated no dysrhythmia during this time .\\nThe patient underwent an echocardiogram which demonstrated a preserved ejection fraction with left ventricular hypertrophy and no significant valvular abnormalities .\\nThe patient was maintained on her aspirin and Lasix .\\nThe patient 's Diltiazem was stopped due to her increased blood pressure and was started on Labetalol which was gradually titrated up to a target blood pressure of 160-170 systolic in her right arm .\\nThe patient also underwent an Adenosine MIBI stress test which showed only mild lateral ischemia .\\nAt this time , the patient 's presyncopal symptoms were not felt to be secondary to a cardiovascular etiology .\\n2 ) Neurological / vascular :\\nThe discrepancy in the patient 's pulses and blood pressure was felt to be consistent with a subclavian artery stenosis .\\nThe patient underwent MRI / MRA of the head , neck and upper chest which demonstrated a proximal left subclavian artery stenosis , proximal to the take off of the left vertebral artery .\\nThe left vertebral artery had a decreased flow consistent with either native vessel disease or some degree of retrograde flow with subclavian steal phenomenon .\\nThe patient had patent carotids bilaterally on her neck MRA .\\nMRI of the head demonstrated a small vessel disease and was likely an old right cerebellar infarct .\\nThe patient underwent non-invasive carotid ultrasounds which demonstrated no significant carotid disease .\\nThe patient was also noted to have antegrade flow in both of her vertebral arteries bilaterally .\\nThe results of these studies suggested that the patient 's symptoms were not due to subclavian steal phenomenon , and therefore , it was decided that the patient would not go further to angio and / or surgical or percutaneous intervention .\\nA Neurology consult was obtained and it was felt that the most valuable intervention that could be done for the patient 's intervascular disease would be adequate control of her blood pressure .\\n3 ) Orthopedic :\\nThe patient suffered a fall at home with her initial event .\\nOutside hip films were obtained , but were not available for view .\\nRepeat hip films demonstrated a right sided pubic rami fracture , likely new .\\nAn Orthopedics consult was obtained and the patient was encouraged to weight bear as tolerated with Physical Therapy assistance .\\nA bone scan was also obtained to rule out an occult hip fracture which was negative .\\nAt the time of this dictation , the patient was able to bear weight with the assistance of Physical Therapy and a walker .\\nPlans were made for the patient to be discharged to Dwardmegriff Rehabilitation for rehabilitation of her rami fracture .\\n4 ) Gastrointestinal :\\nThe patient had an episode of her described vertigo while lying in bed and on the monitor during which no dysrhythmia was noted .\\nThe patient also complained of frequent vomiting at least once a day , occasionally associated with ingestion of her medications , but sometimes associated with ambulation .\\nThe patient has a long-standing history of spontaneous emesis due to overwhelming stress or excitement .\\nHowever , the patient reports emesis in the hospital more frequently .\\nThe patient 's emesis was noted to be bilious without evidence of new or old blood .\\nThe etiology of the patient 's nausea remained unclear as she demonstrated ability to keep down many of her meals which did not suggest an anatomical lesion of her gastrointestinal tract .\\nThe patient was started on Meclizine on December 31 , 2000 for her nausea and vertigo .\\nAn attempt was also made to reduce the patient 's large number of medications and the patient 's Os-Cal , multivitamin , Lasix and Colace were discontinued .\\n5 ) Infectious disease :\\nThe patient complained of some urinary incontinence and difficulty initiating urine on December 30 , 2000 .\\nUrinalysis demonstrated a likely urinary tract infection .\\nThe patient was started on Levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. q. day times seven days for a possible nosocomial urinary tract infection .\\nThe urine culture was pending at the time of this dictation .\\n6 ) Fluids , electrolytes and nutrition :\\nThe patient

on the left side , 2+ femoral , popliteal , DP , PT , and radial .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nCBC was 8.7 , 25.3 , and 184 .\\nCoags 12.2 , 24.8 , and 1.0 .\\nHer gas was 7.47/40/332 .\\nElectrolytes were 143 , 3.4 , 105 , 28 , 24 , 3 , and 131 .\\nEKG showed normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and incomplete left bundle branch block .\\nCT scan showed an anterior mediastinal mass compressing the trachea with air .\\nIt was consistent with a hematoma .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nMs. Shuffa underwent an EGD and flexible bronchoscopy on 9/16/00 shortly after she arrived .\\nThis showed tracheal compressions but no other lesions that were obvious at the time .\\nShe was hemodynamically stable and remained on the ventilator .\\nThe differential diagnoses at this point consisted of hematoma vs. neoplasm vs. an abscess vs. a thyroid tumor .\\nOn 9/22/00 , she underwent a cervical mediastinoscopy .\\nA biopsy of this mass was consistent with hematoma .\\nThe operative report shows that there was an abnormal area below the trachea to the left which represented a cavity between the esophagus , trachea , aorta , and spine that was full of clot .\\nThere was no active bleeding at the time .\\nOver the next several days , the patient remained hemodynamically stable on the ventilator .\\nShe had an elevated calcium level that raised the suspicion that this mass could be a hematoma coming from a ruptured parathyroid adenoma .\\nThe ionized calcium was elevated as was the parathormone level .\\nGiven these findings , she underwent a Sestamibi scan .\\nThe Sestamibi scan showed findings that were consistent with a parathyroid adenoma in the right lobe of the thyroid .\\nAt this time , it was believed that her clot was due to a rupture of this parathyroid adenoma .\\nDr. Ear brought the patient to the operating room on 10/5/00 .\\nShe underwent a parathyroid exploration with resection of a ruptured ectopic right upper parathyroid adenoma , a biopsy of a normal left and right lower parathyroids , resection of a left upper parathyroid , and tracheostomy .\\nShe tolerated the procedure well and was transferred back to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit with her new tracheostomy working well .\\nHer postoperative course was complicated by serosanguineous pleural effusion on the left .\\nThis required a chest tube .\\nHer hematocrit continued to drop over the next couple of days despite normal platelet count , normal coags , and no obvious source of bleeding .\\nIt was believed that she was continuing to bleed in her chest .\\nHowever , we are not quite sure why this was occurring .\\nShe underwent an extensive workup by Hematology that revealed a bleeding diatheses of unknown etiology .\\nIt turns out that several people in her family have a similar bleeding diathesis of unknown etiology .\\nIn conclusion , by systems :\\n1. Neuro .\\nThe patient became intermittently agitated .\\nWe have been giving her Haldol at bedtime as well as Ativan p.r.n. throughout the day .\\nShe responds well to this .\\nShe speaks some English and seems to understand more than she speaks .\\nShe has a family member who is present for approximately 12 hours each day .\\nShe has been very helpful in translating and seems to say that Ms. Shuffa is in good spirits .\\n2. Cardiac .\\nThe patient 's blood pressure has been ranging from approximately 140 to 160 systolic .\\nThis is on a current regimen of Lopressor 25 mg per NG tube t.i.d. as well as Diltiazem 60 mg per NG tube t.i.d. , and lisinopril 10 mg per NG tube q.d. She occasionally gets hypertensive when she is agitated .\\nFor this , we have given her 10 mg of hydralazine .\\nHer blood pressure responds well to this .\\nOtherwise , she is in normal sinus rhythm and has been hemodynamically stable throughout her hospitalization .\\nThe patient developed a left femoral artery pseudoaneurysm after placement of a Greenfield filter .\\nThis has been followed by the Vascular Surgery Service here at the Ingree and Ot of Weamanshy Medical Center .\\nDr. Lenni Lung has been consulted .\\nThe aneurysm at the time of discharge is approximately 2.5 cm .\\nThey elected not to inject it with thrombin .\\nThey asked that the patient follow-up with Dr. Ear in approximately three to four weeks so that this aneurysm can be assessed .\\nThey have opted for conservative management given the size .\\n3. Respiratory .\\nAt the time of discharge , the patient remained on CPAP with a PEEP of 7.5 and a pressure support of 9 .\\nShe seems to be tolerating this well as she has an O2 sat of 100% on 40% FIO2 .\\nHer chest x-ray shows a left lower lobe hematoma that had greatly improved in the last few days .\\nHer right lung field is clear .\\nHer tracheostomy is functioning well , and we have had no problems with it .\\nShe will obviously need to be weaned as tolerated .\\nWe had her down to a low pressure support of 7 in the last week .\\nWith the pressure support at 7 , she became tachypneic and had to be brought back up to 10 .\\nHer oxygen saturation has always been good .\\n4. GI .\\nThe patient is getting tube feeds via her NG tube of full strength Jevity of 75 cc per hour .\\nThis is her goal .\\nShe tolerates them very well and has approximately 200 cc to 300 cc of stool per day .\\nLast week , she had copious amounts of stool in the range of 500 cc to 1000 cc of liquid stool per day .\\nStool cultures have been sent numerous times as well as analysis for C. difficile toxin .\\nThese have all been negative .\\nWe believe the this was an osmotic diarrhea .\\nSince her tube feeds have been changed from full strength Nephro to Jevity , her diarrhea has resolved .\\nShe has been taking Zantac , and the pH of her NG tube residuals have been in the 5 to 8 range .\\n5. GU .\\nThe patient has had hypernatremia .\\nShe is approximately 10 kg up her overall body weight .\\nWe believe her to still be total body overloaded .\\nOver the last several days , we have been giving her approximately 500 cc to 1000 cc of free water through her NG tube .\\nWe also have been diuresing her with Bumex .\\nThis seems to trend her sodium down .\\nThis will need to be monitored closely .\\nHer BUN and creatinine have been normal , and she has always made good urine .\\n6. Heme .\\nAs stated before , the patient continued to ooze into her pleural space well after her definitive operation .\\nShe had an extensive workup by Hematology which revealed a bleeding diathesis of unknown origin .\\nBefore we removed her chest tube , we had to give her platelets .\\nShe had no problems with this .\\nAt the time of discharge , her hematocrit is stable in the 28 to 33 range .\\nI stress that she cannot be anticoagulated .\\nWe have given her Lovenox in the past , and she continues to bleed .\\nTherefore , she is on no DVT prophylaxis .\\nShe does have a left iliac deep vein thrombosis .\\nShe has a Greenfield filter in place , and this is her only DVT prophylaxis .\\n7. ID .\\nAt the time of discharge , the patient has a urinary tract infection .\\nShe is growing Enterobacter cloacae that is sensitive only to Macrodantin from her urine cultures .\\nInterestingly enough , she also has Enterobacter cloacae growing out of her sputum .\\nThis is also sensitive only to Macrodantin .\\nWe do not believe that she has any respiratory process going on at the time .\\nShe is just begun on Macrodantin at the day of discharge and should continue 100 mg per NG tube q.i.d. for a ten day course .\\nHer Foley was changed the day before discharge .\\n8. Tubes , lines , and drains .\\nThe patient has a tracheostomy , NG tube , and a Foley catheter .\\nHer central line , which was left subclavian quad lumen , was removed on the day of discharge .\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\\nAlbuterol nebulizers 2.5 mg q.4h. and Atrovent nebulizers 0.5 mg q.4h. , please alternate albuterol and Atrovent ; Rocaltrol 0.25 mcg per NG tube q.d.; calcium carbonate 1250 mg per NG tube q.i.d.; vitamin B12 1000 mcg IM q. month , next dose is due Nov 18 ; diltiazem 60 mg per NG tube t.i.d.; ferrous sulfate 300 mg per NG t.i.d.; Haldol 5 mg IV q.h.s.; hydralazine 10 mg IV q.6h. p.r.n. hypertension ; lisinopril 10 mg per NG tube q.d.; Ativan 1 mg per NG tube q.h.s.; Lopressor 25 mg per NG tube t.i.d.; Zantac 150 mg per NG tube b.i.d.; multivitamin 10 ml per NG tube q.d.; Macrodantin 100 mg per NG tube q.i.d. x 10 days beginning on 11/3/00 .\\nCONDITION :\\nStable , with active problems being respiratory failure , urinary tract infection , and bleeding diathesis .\\nDISCHARGE LABS :\\nOn the day of discharge , sodium 145 , potassium 4.1 , chloride 109 , bicarb 31 , creatinine 0.7 , BUN 43 , glucose 116 .\\nCBC 14.9 , 29.2 ( which is stable ) , and 398 .\\nPT 12 , PTT 27 , and INR 1.0 .\\nMagnesium of 1.9 .\\nCalcium 8.1 .\\nCOMPLICATIONS :\\nNone .\\nDISPOSITION :\\nThe patient is being discharged to an acute rehab facility .\\nShe should follow-up with Dr. Ryna Jescdrig as well as Dr. Lenni Lung in the Vascular Surgery Department in approximately three to four weeks .\\nPlease call the Surgical Intensive Care Unit at Verg Medical Center for any further details that may be needed .\\nYou can also page Sta Lung , M.D. as I am the dictating physician who has been taking care of Ms. Shuffa for quite some time now .\\nI would be happy to answer any questions .\\nMy pager number at Verg Medical Center is number 54930 .\\nDictated By :\\nSTA LUNG , M.D. HU53\\nAttending :\\nRYNA R.

metastatic angiosarcoma who presents as a transfer from Nacalv Medical Center with a fever to 101 , vomiting times one and \" left kidney pain \" .\\nThis patient is an unfortunate young gentleman who was initially diagnosed with a germ cell tumor in the fall of 1997 after undergoing orchiectomy with a left scrotal mass and underwent three cycles of DEP therapy for pulmonary involvement .\\nIn the summer of 1998 he was found to have a retroperitoneal mass which ultimately revealed angiosarcoma of presumed germ-cell transformation .\\nIn early 1999 he underwent resection of this mass however in February of 1999 he was found to have a new right pleural mass and subsequently underwent pleurodesis and chemotherapy with ifosfamide and Adriamycin for six cycles .\\nIn 05/99 he had increasing abdominal pain and evaluation revealed extensive progressive retroperitoneal disease as well as left hydronephrosis .\\nIn early 2000 he was started on therapy with Taxol per Dr. Azel Hibbskays and finished this in March of this year .\\nCT imaging at that time was negative for disease .\\nIn April of this year , he was found to have acute renal failure with left hydronephrosis and this was treated with percutaneous nephrostomy tube on that side .\\nThereafter he began chemotherapy with Taxotere in 05/13 and his nephrostomy tube was removed after being displaced on 06/14/00 .\\nMost recently he has had problems with nausea , vomiting , fever and left sided abdominal pain and was admitted to the Pointexasp Region General Hospital on 06/16/00 .\\nThat hospital course was sign for hydration , antibiotics for questionable pneumonia and more importantly , tachycardia and respiratory distress ultimately secondary to a large left pulmonary arterial mass that was likely a thrombus .\\nHe was treated with intra-arterial thrombolysis ( TPA ) and was discharged on 06/28/00 on high dose , low molecular weight Heparin .\\nIt was entirely clear that this mass represents a clot , certainly this could have been tumor embolization .\\nFinally , the patient developed hyponatremia with a sodium down to 130 and was otherwise eventually discharged to Pre Health with morphine for comfort care and advanced care plans , not to be resuscitated in the event of a life-threatening situation .\\nMr. Pruesschird returns tonight after being found to have a temperature of 101 , last evening and early this morning in addition to nausea , vomiting times one earlier today .\\nAs well he has complained of some vague left abdominal / flank pain that he attributes to \" kidney pain \" .\\nHe was given Flagyl and had already apparently been on Levofloxacin at the outside hospital since his recent discharge for questionable pneumonia .\\nMr. Pruesschird denies headaches , chest pain and any change in his breathing or comfort with breathing .\\nHe denies persistent vomiting , abdominal pain , other than as mentioned , new skin changes or diarrhea .\\nThere is no joint swelling or

Medical Center .\\nAs the patient 's early evaluation the patient underwent an aortogram which showed an ascending aortic graft with bulging flaps and a pseudoaneurysm at the anastomosis of the graft and arch just below the great vessels .\\nThere was no evidence for a definite leak but there was evidence for gas bubbles in the anterior posterior distal ends of the grafts consistent with an infectious process .\\nAt the same time the patient was seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease Service who upon culturing the patient 's sternal drainage switched the patient from intravenous Unasyn to Levofloxacin for what appeared to be Citrobacter and Diphtheroids in the wound cultures .\\nSubsequent to starting this antibiotic regimen the patient 's wound drainage appeared to subside .\\nGiven all the findings on the aortogram and the subsequent chest computer tomogram scan it was discovered that the patient 's only real surgical option for cure was a risky operation that involved removal and replacement of the aortic graft probably with homograft and long term antibiotic coverage as well as a plastic surgical reconstructive procedure .\\nThe patient understood the risks and potential benefits of the procedure and was willing to proceed .\\nThe patient otherwise complained of no angina , no shortness of breath , no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , no edema , no palpitations or symptoms of syncope .\\nHe did report a 20 lbs weight loss over the last several months .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1. Thoracic aneurysm repair .\\n2. Hypertension .\\n3. Status post hernia repair .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\n1. Lopressor 100 mg po three times a day .\\n2. Captopril 75 mg po three times a day .\\n3. Prilosec 20 mg po per day .\\n4. Hydralazine 12.5 mg four times per day .\\n5. Reglan 10 mg po three times a day .\\nALLERGIES :\\nNo known drug allergies .\\nFAMILY HISTORY :\\nNoncontributory .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nThe patient was married and denied any tobacco or alcohol use .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nThe patient was afebrile , vital signs were stable .\\nHead , eyes , ears , nose and throat exam :\\nnegative .\\nNeck was supple .\\nThere was no jugular venous distention .\\n2+ carotids without bruits .\\nCardiovascular exam :\\nregular rate and rhythm with a 2/6 diastolic ___ and a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur .\\nHis lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally without any evidence for crackles .\\nExtremities :\\nthe patient had 2+ femoral pulses and 1+ pedal pulses .\\nLABORATORY AND RADIOLOGIC DATA :\\nSodium 137 , potassium 4.0 , blood urea nitrogen 16 , creatinine .9 , white blood cell count 4.9 , hematocrit 29.7 , platelet count 207 .\\nThe patient 's preoperative chest x-ray showed bilateral effusions and bibasilar atelectasis .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nThe patient 's sternal incision had a superior edge that was dehisced with evidence for stay sutures and some superficial closure sutures exposed .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was initially admitted to the Cardiac Surgical Service under Dr. Rhalt .\\nThe patient was admitted to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit given the patient 's precarious condition .\\nOver the next several hospital days the patient underwent aortogram as well as chest computer tomogram as outlined earlier .\\nThe patient was also seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease Service as well as the Cardiology Service who assisted in managing the patient 's intermittent hypertension .\\nThe patient was also seen preoperatively in consultation by the Plastic Surgical Service for potential sternal reconstruction .\\nAfter lengthy discussions with the patient and the patient 's family as well as the various consultant services it was decided that the patient was a viable candidate for aortic root replacement procedure using homograft .\\nThis was obtained on 08/30/98 by Dr. Niste Rhalt of the Cardiac Surgical Service .\\nThe patient was then subsequently taken to the Operating Room on 08/31/98 with the preoperative diagnosis of ascending aortic graft infection .\\nThe procedure performed was homograft replacement of the ascending aorta with omentopexy and an open chest .\\nThe aortic perfusions were via the femoral artery with venous return by the femoral vein .\\nThe cardiopulmonary bypass time was one hour and 49 minutes .\\nThe graft used was a homograft .\\nThe patient tolerated the procedure fairly well and was transferred intubated to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit with his chest open .\\nThe immediate postoperative plans were for a short Intensive Care Unit stay and subsequent plastic surgical reconstruction of the patient 's sternum .\\nThe patient was transferred to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition .\\nThere he continued to be hemodynamically stable .\\nOf note , intraoperatively multiple tissue cultures had been sent .\\nIn the Intensive Care Unit the patient was kept intubated and sedated until 09/02/98 which was postoperative day no. 1 following the homograft replacement .\\nOn that day the Plastic Surgical Service performed further sternal debridement and subsequent reconstruction using bilateral pectoralis major myocutaneous advancement flaps and right superiorly rectus abdominis flap to cover the patient 's sternal wound with subsequent primary closure of that wound .\\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications .\\nA number of indwelling closed suction drains were left in place so as to drain the bed underneath the muscle flaps .\\nThe patient was then transferred back to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition .\\nAt this point the patient continued to followed by Infectious Disease Service and continued to be on intravenous antibiotics which included Vancomycin and Levofloxacin .\\nThe Operating Room cultures at that point were positive for Crinobactermium with sputum cultures being sensitive for yeast and gram positive cocci in clusters .\\nOver the next postoperative day the patient was awakened and weaned to extubate without significant difficulties .\\nThe patient 's subsequent postoperative course was characterized by persistent hypertension which required a significant amount of antihypertensives including Lopressor 100 mg po three times a day , Captopril 100 mg po three times a day , as well as Procardia .\\nThe patient otherwise continued to do well and was becoming more oriented as time went on and as his blood pressure was brought under control .\\nSubsequently on postoperative day no. 8 in the Intensive Care Unit the patient was felt to be ready for transfer to the Cardiac Surgical Inpatient Service .\\nThe patient continued to be followed by the Infectious Disease Service who felt that the patient 's Jackson Pratt drains needed to stay in as there was still some significant drainage from them .\\nAs per the Infectious Disease Service the patient was continued on Levofloxacin , Vancomycin as antibiotic coverage .\\nHowever on 09/08/98 the Infectious Disease Service was made aware that the patient 's intraoperative cultures had also grown out Mycoplasma humilius .\\nGiven this finding it was felt that the patient would certainly need long term intravenous antibiotics to include at least six weeks of Vancomycin and then subsequent Levofloxacin for the Citrobacter and Mycoplasma as well .\\nThe patient was scheduled for peripherally inserted central catheter line placement knowing that he was going to need long term intravenous antibiotics .\\nThis was placed on postoperative day no. 9 without any difficulty .\\nAt the same time the patient continued to be stable on his antihypertensive regimen .\\nHe was becoming more mobile and was taking a high protein high calories diet which he tolerated well .\\nHe continued to be afebrile and otherwise very stable .\\nOn postoperative day no. 12 the patient was noted to have fallen and subsequently dislocating the PIP joint of his left middle finger .\\nSubsequent hand x-rays obtained showed no evidence of fracture but the patient was seen in consultation by the Plastic Surgery Hand Service .\\nThe patient will benefit from splinting of his finger while the swelling subsided and subsequent early mobilization to prevent any rigidity in that joint .\\nThe patient was also seen subsequently in consultation by the Plastic Surgical Service who discontinued a number of the patient 's indwelling drains but they felt that others needed to stay while the patient was sent to rehabilitation .\\nThese drains will then be subsequently taken out by Dr. General upon his followup with the patient .\\nPrior to discharge the patient also underwent an audiogram as a baseline hearing test while the patient was to stay on long term intravenous antibiotics .\\nThe patient otherwise continued to be hemodynamically stable making good progress .\\nAs a matter of fact the patient made remarkable progress given the severity of his disease condition prior to the operation .\\nThe patient 's condition continued to be improved .\\nGiven this finding the patient was therefore felt to be ready for discharge to a rehabilitation facility on 09/13/1998 .\\nIn consultation with the Infectious Disease Service the patient was to stay on long term intravenous antibiotics .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nGood .\\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :\\nDiet :\\nHigh calorie , high protein .\\nThe patient 's treatment will include typical peripherally inserted central catheter line care with frequent wound checks .\\nThe patient prior to discharge was fitted with an orthoplast finger splint as manufactured by Occupational Therapy Services Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .\\nThe patient was also instructed in range of motion exercises for the left middle finger .\\nThe patient on discharge is to have twice weekly Vancomycin peak and trough levels while he continues on long term Vancomycin therapy .\\nThe patient was instructed to return to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital if he developed any signs of wound infection such a erythema , drainage , or increasing incisional pain .\\nThe patient was instructed to be vigilant for any fevers or chills .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\n1. Vancomycin 750 mg intravenous q 18h.\\n2. Levofloxacin 500 mg po per day .\\n3. Prilosec 20 mg po per day .\\n4. Captopril 100 mg po three times a day .\\n5. Lopressor 100 mg po three times a day .\\n6. Albuterol nebulizers q6h as needed .\\n7. Atrovent nebulizers q6h as needed .\\n8. Lasix 20 mg po per day .\\n9. Kay-Ciel 20 mEq po per day .\\nFOLLOWUP :\\nThe patient was instructed that he needed to followup with Dr. Rhalt by calling his office for appointment at 763-6361 subsequent to his discharge to his rehabilitation facility in Oaksale Lavalle .\\nThe patient was also instructed to followup with Dr. Both of the Cardiology Service Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital following his discharge so that his antihypertension medications could be appropriately adjusted .\\nThe patient will also be seen in followup by Dr. Chpo E. Enla General of the Plastic Surgery Service Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital so that his indwelling Jackson Pratt drains be appropriately management and if needed be discontinued by him .\\nThe patient will also be followed by the Infectious Disease Service so as to ascertain the exact length and course of his antibiotic therapy .\\nThe patient was instructed to followup with Dr. Naco Mesprhalt of the Infectious Disease Service by calling her office for an appointment at 094-902-2879 to be seen in approximately four weeks following the patient 's discharge .\\nDr. Dau 's recommendation is that the patient is to stay on Vancomycin and Levofloxacin for approximately six weeks following discharge and then subsequently on antibiotic regimen for chronic suppression .\\nRYNA DAU ,

REQUIRING CHRONIC DIALYSIS .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient is a 63 year-old woman transferred from Pre Health on June 19 , 1998 to the Verg Medical Center Intensive Care Unit for evaluation of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia .\\nOn May 12 , 1998 , the patient presented to Pre Health with fever , cough , dyspnea and a chest x-ray revealing a patchy infiltrate in the right lung .\\nShe was treated with Clindamycin and Erythromycin which were changed to Trovan and then transferred to A Hospital .\\nOn May 27 , 1998 , the patient desaturated to 40% with a temperature of 100.5 degrees .\\nHer oxygen saturations improved to only 92% on 100% face mask and she was admitted to Pre Health Intensive Care Unit .\\nChest x-ray there revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with increasing pleural effusion .\\nA VQ scan was high probability , but no pulmonary angiogram was done and an echocardiogram revealed a normal left ventricle with no wall motion abnormality and an ejection fraction of 75% .\\nOn May 24 , 1998 , the patient had a CT scan of the chest which revealed diffuse alveolar infiltrates at the right base , mediastinal lymphadenopathy and bilateral pleural effusions .\\nAt this point , a diagnosis of lupus was considered and her ANA was 1:640 and her rheumatoid factor and ANCA were negative .\\nShe was started on a steroid trial at that point .\\nHer pleural fluid was tapped and it was negative for malignancy .\\nOn June 11 , 1998 , the patient had a video assisted thoracoscopic study of the right lung which revealed chronic interstitial pneumonitis with a bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia-like reaction and a chest tube was placed .\\nThe patient was then started on 40 mg of Prednisone q. day .\\nFrom May 27 , 1998 through June 19 , 1998 , the patient had a decline in her platelets from 394 to 28 with a stable hematocrit of 32 to 33 and a rise in creatinine from 1.0 to 3.8 .\\nOn June 19 , 1998 , she was transferred to the Verg Medical Center Medical Intensive Care Unit for evaluation of possible thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1 ) Cerebrovascular accident in 1995 in the pontine region secondary to hypertension .\\n2 ) Hypertension .\\n3 ) Status post hysterectomy .\\n4 ) Status post appendectomy .\\nMEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER :\\n1 ) Albuterol inhaler 4 puffs q.i.d.\\n2 ) Lasix p.r.n.\\n3 ) Prednisone 40 mg p.o. q. day .\\n4 ) Inderal 40 mg p.o. q.i.d.\\n5 ) Thiamine .\\n6 ) Lasix p.r.n.\\n7 ) Atrovent inhaler 4 puffs q.i.d.\\n8 ) Folic acid .\\n9 ) Premarin 0.625 mg p.o. q. day .\\n10 ) Omeprazole 20 mg p.o. q. day .\\n11 ) Insulin sliding scale .\\nALLERGIES :\\nThe patient had no known drug allergies .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nThe patient is divorced .\\nShe has two children .\\nShe recently retired as a clerical worker .\\nShe denies any tobacco .\\nShe has only social alcohol use .\\nFAMILY HISTORY :\\nFather died at age 56 of coronary artery disease .\\nMother died at age 68 of pancreatic carcinoma .\\nBrother has coronary artery disease .\\nThere is no family history of hematologic problems .\\nLABORATORY :\\nLaboratory studies on admission were notable for a sodium of 131 , potassium 6.2 , BUN 111 , creatinine 3.9 , white blood cell count 23 , hematocrit 27 with 2+ schistocytes and 2+ spherocytes on the smear , platelet count 92 and LDH 496 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\n1 ) Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia :\\nThe video assisted thoracoscopic study at the outside hospital was consistent with bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia .\\nThe patient was continued on steroids throughout the course of her stay .\\nThis was changed to Solu-Medrol part way through the course due to her hematologic problems , see below .\\nBy discharge , she was returned to 40 mg of Prednisone q. day times one month to be followed by a slow taper .\\nThe patient 's bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia appeared to improve slowly throughout her hospital course , however on July 12 , 1998 , after starting dialysis ( see below ) , the patient desaturated and required supplemental oxygen .\\nRepeat chest x-rays and chest CT scans appeared consistent with pulmonary edema from volume overload given her renal failure and eventually , the patient 's pulmonary status did improve after significant volume removal with dialysis for several weeks .\\nAt the time of her discharge , the patient was still requiring two liters of supplemental oxygen to maintain her oxygen saturations in the mid 90% .\\n2 ) Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura :\\nThe patient was initially admitted with platelet count of 28 , hematocrit of 32 , LDH of 496 with 2+ schistocytes and 2+ spherocytes on her smear .\\nThis was felt to be consistent with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and on June 20 , 1998 , she was started on daily plasma exchange which continued through July 27 , 1999 .\\nShe was also changed to intravenous Solu-Medrol 50 mg q. day which was changed back to 40 mg of Prednisone prior to discharge .\\nHer platelet count initially rose to a maximum of 159 on July 3 , 1998 , then they steadily fell to a low of 60 on July 20 , 1999 .\\nHer LDH which peaked at 1255 decreased to the mid 200s , but remained elevated .\\nShe continued to have a few schistocytes on her smear , but it was much decreased .\\nThe patient also required red blood cell transfusions , approximately two units every seven to ten days to maintain her hematocrit .\\nEventually , her plasma exchange was tapered to a smaller and smaller dose each day and then discontinued altogether after July 27 , 1999 .\\nAfter this , the patient 's platelet count rose to a maximum of 177 on discharge .\\nIt is felt that the patient 's thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has resolved .\\nShe will continue on her Prednisone for one month as above for the bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia with a very slow taper .\\n3 ) Renal :\\nThe patient presented in acute renal failure with a BUN of 101 and a creatinine of 3.7 .\\nThroughout the month of June , she had a rising Potassium phosphate and increasing volume overload with decreasing response to diuretics and she was finally initiated on dialysis with ultrafiltration on July 12 , 1998 .\\nThe opinion of the Renal consult was that this was permanent and non-reversible renal failure since it did not improve with dialysis and the patient will continue on dialysis three times per week .\\nShe required approximately five liters of ultrafiltration fluid removal at each dialysis session due to her significant volume overload .\\nDuring the course of her dialysis , she had a great improvement in her lower extremity edema and her oxygen saturation .\\n4 ) Infectious disease :\\nThe patient had multiple line infections during her admission including a confirmed coag. negative Staphylococcus line infection with positive blood cultures on June 23 , 1998 , July 4 , 1998 , July 8 , 1998 and July 9 , 1998 .\\nThe patient eventually had a left subclavian Tesio catheter placed and a right brachial PICC line placed on July 10 , 1998 which remained patent and uninfected .\\nShe received a full three week course of Vancomycin and also received a three week course of Ceftazidime .\\nIn addition , she had a fungal urinary tract infection treated with Amphojel bladder irrigation , which was followed by a Klebsiella urinary tract infection for which she received Levofloxacin times fourteen days .\\nShe also received a fourteen day course of Acyclovir which was begun on June 21 , 1998 for perianal lesions consistent with herpes simplex virus .\\nShe was also on Fluconazole for some oral thrush which was inadvertently continued for a total of thirty days .\\nThe patient was also started on Bactrim one double strength tablet q.o.d. as prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia while on her high dose steroids .\\n5 ) Rheumatology :\\nThe patient was admitted with a question of lupus given her ANA of 1:640 although her rheumatoid factor and ANCA were negative .\\nUnfortunately throughout her admission , we were unable to test any more titers since she was receiving daily plasma exchange .\\nA repeat ANA , rheumatoid factor and ANCA may be repeated as an outpatient .\\nFOLLOW-UP :\\n1 ) The patient will follow-up with her primary care physician , Dr. Tamarg Study , in Arvus after she is discharged from rehabilitation .\\n2 ) The patient is being discharged to A Hospital where she will receive onsite hemodialysis three times per week on Monday , Wednesday and Friday .\\nThe nephrologist who will follow her there is Dr. Study .\\n3 ) The patient will continue to have her CBC , LDH , bilirubin , chem-7 and magnesium and calcium checked with each dialysis and the results will be faxed to Dr. Ian Zineisfreierm , the hematology attending at fax number 751-329-8840 .\\n4 ) The patient will eventually need a permanent dialysis fistula .\\nThe left subclavian Tesio which she has in place will last for several months in the mean time .\\nShe would like to arrange to have her fistula placed at Pre Health and the vascular surgeons there should be contacted regarding this .\\n5 ) The patient will need packed red blood cell transfusions with dialysis when her hematocrit falls below 26 .\\n6 ) The patient will continue her Prednisone at 40 mg p.o. q. day times one month ( this was started on July 27 , 1999 ) and then she will begin a slow taper as guided by Pulmonary .\\n7 ) The patient

deep venous thrombosis , and pulmonary embolus who presents with a change in mental status and a fall at home .\\nHis family stated that he had a progressive mental decline over the past three years and was initially diagnosed with Parkinson \\'s disease or features consistent with Parkinsonism .\\nThis was poorly responsive to Eldopa .\\nHe was later seen by Dr. Flo Cuchkote at the Ph University Of Medical Center and diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy .\\nOver the five to six weeks prior to admission he had a drop off in his mental functioning with more frequent episodes of confusion and disorientation and requiring more assistance with his activities of daily living .\\nHe also developed a urinary incontinence .\\nHe had had two falls to his wife \\'s recollection , both times slipping off the edge of a chair backwards .\\nOn the morning of admission at 8 o\\'clock , he was noted to be moving his mouth less and speaking \" gibberish \" .\\nHe was later sitting in a chair making multiple attempts to get up , which he subsequently did and promptly fell directly on his face at approximately 11:30 a.m.\\nThere was no definite clonic activity .\\nThere was no known incontinence .\\nHe was taken to an outside hospital and nasally intubated and then transferred to the Ph University Of Medical Center Emergency Room where he was orally intubated .\\nA trauma evaluation was negative and thus he was transferred to the Neurology Service .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nCoumadin 4 mgs po qhs , Vasotec 5 mgs po qd , Lasix prn , Digoxin 0.25 mgs poqd , Proscar and Sinemet .\\nALLERGIES :\\nno known drug allergies .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1) atrial fibrillation on coumadin ,\\n2) deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus ; the wife states since he was in the infantry in World War II .\\n3) Question progressive supranuclear palsy .\\n4) old right frontal infarct .\\n5) hypertension .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nHe lives with his wife who is his primary care giver .\\nHe is a former professor at Montana .\\nTobacco ; he has some distant history of some very minimal use .\\nAlcohol ; he has no recent use .\\nHe was a previous drinker of one \" old fashioned \" every night .\\nFAMILY HISTORY :\\nHe has a father who had dementia .\\nThere was no history of strokes or bleeding disorders in the family .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nvital signs in the emergency room were 210/100 for blood pressure , heart rate 70 and irregular .\\nHe was afebrile .\\nIn general he was an intubated elderly frail appearing white male with blood about his face .\\nhead , eyes , ears , nose and throat examination ; abrasions about his forehead , there was some minimal swelling associated .\\nHis neck was rigid ; 1+ carotids without bruits .\\noropharynx was intubated with blood as well .\\nLungs ; clear to auscultation bilaterally .\\nCardiovascular examination ; regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs , or gallops .\\nAbdominal examination ; soft , non-tender , non-distended , normal active bowel sounds .\\nExtremities :\\nno clubbing , cyanosis , or edema .\\nNeurologically ; he opens his eyes to voice .\\nHe does not regard the examiner .\\nHe had no blink to threat .\\nHis pupils were three down to two on the right and five down to four on the left .\\nAccording to the family this iansicoria was old .\\nHe had intact corneals bilaterally and intact horizontal dull movements bilaterally .\\nHe had left greater than right nasal stimulation to grimace .\\nHe had no gag to tube manipulation .\\nMotor examination he had a weak withdrawal to nail bed pressure in both hands .\\nHe triple flexed his bilateral lower extremities to pain .\\nHis deep tendon reflexes were 2+ at the right brachial radialis and right patella ; everywhere else his reflexes were 1 .\\nHis toes were down going .\\nSUMMARY OF LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS :\\nsodium 141 , potassium 3.5 , chloride 107 , bicarbonates 23.8 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose 165 , PO2 377 , PCO2 32 , PH 7.50 , asomus 298 , toxic screen negative , white blood cell count 11.1 , hematocrit 39.6 , platelet count 137 , prothrombin time 25.2 , INR 4.3 , partial thromboplastin time 34.7 , urinalysis 1+ albumin, 0-5 high link caths , cervical spine negative , pelvis negative , lumbar spine ; negative , thoracic spine negative .\\nchest x-ray clear .\\nelectrocardiogram showed 2 mm of ST depressions in V4-6 .\\nHead CT scan showed a 2 x 2 x 2 left anterior temporal hemorrhage with minimal surrounding edema .\\nThere was also evidence of an old right frontal infarction .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\\n1) NEUROLOGY :\\nThe patient was admitted to the Neurology Intensive Care Unit for intensive monitoring due to his frail condition .\\nHe had an electroencephalogram performed on his initial admittance to the Intensive Care Unit which did not show any evidence of seizure activity .\\nIt did , however , show diffuse slowing .\\nHe was given 1.5 grams of Dilantin in the emergency room as well as 2 mgs of intravenous Ativan which did little to stop his rhythmic blinking that he showed from time to time on examination .\\nHis hypertension ; his high blood pressure was controlled with intravenous nitroglycerine in the early going and then he was switched to an oral regimen for better control after he was removed from the Intensive Care Unit .\\nHe continued to do well over the next few days and was quite surprisingly intact on both sides of his body in terms of his ability to move .\\nHe did consistently have more movement on the left side of his body than on the right , but he gradually became more awake and alert and communicative and his endotracheal tube was removed on the second day of admission .\\nHis diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy was placed under question on further examination of his eye movement since he was able to have excellent superior gaze especially with the bells phenomenon which would not be seen with progressive supranuclear palsy .\\nIt was felt that his dementing illness and rigidity was most likely due to some type of cortico-basal ganglia degeneration process , but this was not clarified during this admission .\\nIt was not felt likely to be due to Parkinson \\'s disease , as he had no significant response to Eldopa in the past and the patient had no evidence of tremor , although he was quite rigid and bradykinetic .\\nHe had an magnetic resonance imaging performed on October 18 , 1996 .\\nThis showed the unchanged left temporal parenchymal interparenchymal hematoma and the old embolic right frontal infarct , but there were no new lesions and no evidence of his susceptibility studies to suggest old bleeds which might have been consistent with amylase angiopathy .\\nIn addition , he gadolinium scan did not show enhancement at the area of his hemorrhage , so tumor was felt to be unlikely .\\nHowever , this issue will need to be re-evaluated in six months time once the hematoma is less prominent to see if there is possibly an underlying tumor or arterial venous malformation that could be currently compressed by the area of hemorrhage .\\nThe etiology of his bleed was felt to be most likely secondary to hypertension , but these other causes could also not be ruled out .\\n2) CARDIOVASCULAR :\\nHis electrocardiogram was concerning for ischemia .\\nHe was on intravenous TNG and was supratherapeutic on his anti-coagulation .\\nHe did have a slight elevation of his TPK with an additional value of 198 with a MB fraction of 5.7 , which makes for a percentage of 2.9 .\\nThat was at the highest percentage that he had and after this his percentage came down to 1.6 , 1.0 on subsequent CKMBs and was felt that he had a very small \" leaflet \" .\\nHe remained chest pain free throughout his admission .\\n3) PULMONARY :\\nAfter his initial intubation he remained quite stable .\\nHe was found to be at a large aspiration risk given his decreased mental status and the lack of presence of a gag reflex .\\nHowever , he was given aggressive pulmonary toilets including chest physical therapy and aspiration precautions and the patient did not develop any pulmonary symptoms during his admission .\\n4) HEMATOLOGY :\\nHe had his prothrombin time reversed with Vitamin K 2 mgs on admission subcutaneously as well as two units of fresh frozen plasma given in the emergency room .\\nHis anticoagulation status had to be monitored very closely due to his history of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus as well as atrial fibrillation , but he could not be placed on a high amount of anticoagulation because of the new intraparenchymal bleed .\\nIt was decided that his goal INR was to be 2.0 .\\nHe did drop below 1.5 at one time , at which time he was placed on heparin intravenous to carry him through that period , but his discharge INR was around 2 and he was off of heparin at that time .\\nIt was decided that he would have very close monitoring of his anticoagulation status in the future to prevent further problems .\\n5) GASTROINTESTINAL :\\nHe was evaluated by the speech and swallow pathology group at the Ph University Of Medical Center and it was decided that he was able to swallow on his own with a soft solid diet with supervision .\\nThus , his nasogastric tube was discontinued on October 19 , 1996 and he tolerated feeding quite well .\\nIn discussions with the family , given his age and number of medical problems , it was decided that the patient should be do not resuscitate should he have a terminal cardiac event during his admission or during future admissions .\\nHowever , he was still an intubation candidate if it were felt to be a short term procedure .\\nThe family realizes that the long term outlook for this patient is not very good , but they would like to currently continue to provide him with all support necessary , short of resuscitation measures or heroic measures should he have a cardiopulmonary arrest .\\nDISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable .\\nDOCTOR \\'S DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nThe patient was to be discharged to a rehabilitation hospital , the location of which was undetermined at this time of this discharge summary .\\nThe patient is to follow up with Dr. Ria in clinic on one month time and the family is to call me if there were any questions in the interim .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nDilantin 100 mgs po tid , Carafate 1 gram po qid , Digoxin 0.25 mgs po qd , Isordil 20 mgs po tid , Captopril 25 mgs po tid , Lopressor 50 mgs po bid , Colace 100 mgs

CERVICAL POLYPS\\nCHIEF COMPLAINT :\\nThe patient is a 55 year old white female with dilated cardiomyopathy , status post ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation arrest 02/04/94 .\\nShe was transferred to Retelk County Medical Center for further therapy , and transplant evaluation .\\nPatient also received AICD .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient was initially admitted for further therapy of her idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and for transplant evaluation .\\nPatient 's past medical history is to besummarized as follows :\\nIn 1990 the patient was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy in Hispit , Delaware .\\nSince that time the patient has been treated medically .\\nIn 07/93 the patient underwent exercise tolerance test which showed a MBO2 of 12.7 mg per kilogram .\\nOn 09/93 the patient underwent transplant evaluation at Retelk County Medical Center .\\nEchocardiogram showed severe PR and mitral regurgitation , mild AI and ejection fraction of 15% to 20% , a markedly dilated left ventricle and moderately dilated right ventricle , and a question of a possible left ventricular and right ventricular thrombus .\\nConsequently the patient was started on Coumadin .\\nCatheterization at that time showed an RA pressure of 60 , cardiac index of 1.7 , SVR of 2100 and a PVR of 387 .\\nCoronaries were completely normal .\\nConsequently the patient was admitted to the CCU for intensive hemodynamic monitoring , and after load reduction .\\nIn the CCU the patient was initially treated with nitroprusside and eventually switched to Captopril and Isordil .\\nHemodynamics were optimized resulting in a cardiac output of 4.4 with a SVR of 1300 and a wedge of 16 .\\nPulmonary function tests were obtained which showed marked pulmonary dysfunction with FEV1 of 1.4 and markedly decreased ELCL of 50% .\\nRepeat pulmonary function tests following optimization of cardiac therapy showed somewhat improved but not to a significant degree of the pulmonary function tests .\\nFurthermore , due to the patient 's long standing amiodarone therapy , and a positive second pulmonary function , Amiodarone was discontinued during that hospital admission .\\nConsequently the patient was discharged on Captopril , Digoxin , Lasix , Micronase , Isordil and prn inhalers .\\nThe patient did well at home until 1/31/94 when she was admitted to Souland in Nixmont Bovo with increasing congestive heart failure .\\nAt that time the patient was aggressively diuresed .\\nBy report , in the interim since discharge from Retelk County Medical Center , amiodarone was restarted for unclear indications .\\nDring this hospitalization at Hahkellrick Hospital , a dobutamine drip was started to improve hemodynamics , and in the setting of the dobutamine drip the patient had spontaneous ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation arrest .\\nShe was quickly defibrillated and converted to sinus rhythm with a left bundle branch block .\\nShe was treated for a short time with Lidocaine and eventually weaned off .\\nShe was continued on low dose dobutamine and transferred back to Retelk County Medical Center for further evaluation .\\nThe patient was transferred to Retelk County Medical Center on 02/20/94 , again for possible heart-lung transplantation .\\nThe patient was evaluated by the CHF and Heart Transplant Service .\\nIt was felt that the patient was not likely a good transplant candidate secondary to endocurrent lung disease .\\nFurthermore , since it was felt that the patient failed amiodarone therapy , the patient was seen by the Alllo Eino Hospital which recommended EPS to rule out possible bundle branch reentry as the source of the patient 's arrhythmia with possible AICD placement if the EPS was negative .\\nNote , per recommendation from the CHF Team , dobutamine was discontinued within the first 24 hours of the patient 's hospitalization without difficulty .\\nOn 02/22/94 an EPS study was performed .\\nThe patient was negative for inducible ventricular arrhythmias despite maximal stimulation .\\nConsequently AICD placement was recommended .\\nConsequently , the patient underwent AICD placement on 03/09/94 .\\nNote , from 02/22 to 03/09 there is a question of the patient having a right forearm thrombophlebitis .\\nConsequently , the patient underwent a full 2 week course of antibiotic therapy along with debridement of the right forearm for placement of the AICD .\\nNote , biopsies from the right forearm were significant only for inflammation , and not infection .\\nCultures were negative , and note , no pus or purulent fluid was found upon debridement .\\nThus , AICD placement was performed on 03/09/94 following a 2 week course of antibiotic therapy for presumed ( but later found to be inflammation only ) of right forearm phlebitis .\\nThere were no intraoperative or postoperative complications following the AICD placement .\\nBy 03/10/94 the patient was able to ambulate without assistance , and was only having minimal tenderness at the AICD placement site .\\nAt this point it was felt the patient would go home on 03/13/94 .\\nIt was felt that the patient should stay inhouse over the weekend since the patient will be traveling back to Vonamemp , LA via plane by herself .\\nThis was discussed with both the patient and the Cardiology B Team .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nType II diabetes mellitus , cardiomyopathy , bronchitis , history of hypertension , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , and cervical polyps .\\nALLERGIES :\\nNKDA .\\nMEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER

placed in the history of present illness ) , the patient was admitted for further management , and evaluation of transplantation .\\nAs per history of present illness the patient was found to be a poor heart-lung transplantation candidate .\\nAn EPS study was performed which was negative for inducible arrhythmia despite maximal stimulus .\\nConsequently , the patient underwent AICD placement on 03/09/94 .\\nHospital course was only complicated by presumed right forearm thrombophlebitis , and the patient completed a 2 week antibiotic course prior to AICD placement .\\nNote , for the question of the right forearm thrombophlebitis , the right forearm was debrided and sent for culture and pathology .\\nCultures were negative .\\nDebridement was negative for purulent discharge .\\nPathology

Etsystems/ Hospital after suffering an acute anterior myocardial infarction .\\nThe course had multiple complications requiring pressors .\\nHe had a cardiac catheterization performed which revealed a three vessel coronary artery disease with an occluded RCA , 70%-80% proximal LAD , and a high grade left circumflex lesion after the OM with distal left circumflex occlusion .\\nThe patient was subsequently medically management after this hospitalization and has done very well .\\nHis most recent echocardiogram in April of 1996 showed an ejection fraction of 20% with a thin fibrotic septum with akinesis and moderately severe hypokinesis in all other regions except for the lateral wall .\\nThe patient also had an electrocardiogram in April of 1996 which was negative following , however was at a low workload .\\nThe patient 's was most recently admitted to Centdick Naco Hospital Medical Center on Martin Luther King Day after becoming acutely short of breath after a five minute walk .\\nHe had no chest pain , palpitations , diaphoresis , or nausea .\\nHe called the EMT 's and was found to be in pulmonary edema by chest x-ray at Centdick Naco Hospital Medical Center .\\nHe was diuresed and ruled out for myocardial infarction .\\nHis ECG showed no ischemic changes .\\nHe was then transferred to the Retelk County Medical Center for further management .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY

patient referred by Dr. Laymie Aslinke for significant coronary artery disease .\\nHe developed acute pulmonary edema on May 27 , 1993 , and was admitted to Sonpathcermu Jords Hospital , and found to be in rapid atrial fibrillation .\\nHe denied any angina .\\nHe had a gaited cardiac blood pool scan that showed an ejection fraction of 31% .\\nHis pulmonary function tests showed FEV1 of 2.1 , and he was found to have intermittent obstructive sleep apnea .\\nAn echocardiogram showed a dilated left atrium with mitral anular calcification .\\nHe was discharged home but readmitted on May 21 with recurrent congestive heart failure .\\nA Thallium Stress Test showed equivocal ST segment changes with fixed apical and inferior defects .\\nHis coronary risk factors include cigarette smoking , obesity , a family history of coronary disease , and elevated serum cholesterol .\\nHe also has a history of atrial fibrillation with sinus pauses during sleep apnea .\\nOn June 4 , 1993 , he underwent cardiac catheterization .\\nHe was found to have an occluded right coronary artery , 70% distal left main lesion , 80% proximal ramus lesion , and his left ventricular ejection shows preserved function except for akinesis of the inferior wall .\\nHis ejection fraction was 50% , a carotid duplex study showed plaqueing but no critical lesions .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nAs above .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nHe has a wife Pandeprob and lives in Ashing .\\nHe did smoke up to three pack per day .\\nHe has three children .\\nHe is retired .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nSix foot , 250 pounds .\\nHe is a well appearing male , in no distress .\\nHIs blood pressure was 140/70 , pulse 80 and irregular .\\nHis neck veins were not distended .\\nHis carotids showed bilateral bruits .\\nHis lungs are clear .\\nHis cardiac exam shows a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur .\\nHis abdomen is obese , but benign .\\nHis peripheral pulses are intact .\\nHe has no peripheral edema .\\nHis Neurological exam is nonfocal .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nsodium 140 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 104 , CO2 30 , calcium 9.3 , phosphorous 1.2 , BUN 9 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 183 .\\nUric acid 8.4 , bilirubin 0.7 , alkaline phosphatase 72 , amylase 46 , SGOT 20 , and his Digoxin level was 1.0 .\\nhematocrit 38% , white blood cell count 7700 , MCV 86 , PT and PTT were normal .\\nurinalysis was unremarkable .\\nHis chest X-ray was normal with bilateral pleural thickening .\\nHis electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation .\\nThere were nonspecific ST and T wave changes .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to Hellworthston Hospital .\\nThere , he stabilized , and was seen in consultation by Cardiology and Anesthesiology .\\nThere was concern over his sleep apnea , but he appeared to have primarily cardiac disease and therefore because of the left main stenosis , it was reasonable to proceed .\\nOn June 24 , 1993 , Dr. Lenni Breutzoln performed triple coronary bypass surgery .\\nHe placed a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending , single saphenous vein to the posterior descending artery with 170 cc. per minute flow and a single saphenous vein to the circumflex with 140 cc. per minute flow .\\nHe weaned easily off cardiopulmonary bypass .\\nHe had no hemodynamic difficulties .\\nHe was able to wean from the ventilator , but he did have marginal oxygenation throughout .\\nHe did revert back to atrial fibrillation .\\nHe was extubated within forty eight hours .\\nHe was transferred out of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit on June 26 .\\nHe reverted back to atrial fibrillation that required Digoxin , and Verapamil to control .\\nHe could not be converted back to normal sinus rhythm even with a trial of Quinaglute .\\nHe also had anemia and he was seen in consultation by the Nutrition Service .\\nHe was advised to have an ideal body weight of 178 pounds , and clearly a 2300 calorie diet was appropriate for him .\\nWeight reduction would be important in the long term management of his coronary disease .\\nHe was treated with Digoxin and Diuretics along with Ace inhibitors because of his depressed left ventricular function .\\nHe was able to ambulate although somewhat slowly because of his rapid atrial fibrillation .\\nIt was considered to obtain a pulmonary consultation on a formal basis , but it was then felt that he would do better by healing fully from his surgery , because he really had little in the way of pulmonary complications , despite the history of sleep apnea of an obstructive basis .\\nPrimary in his long term management is cardiac rehabilitation with weight reduction .\\nHe will be followed closely in 23 Hwy , Hamp by Dr. Laymie Aslinke .\\nMAY A , M.D.\\nTR :\\not /

.\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nRemoval of left neck lymph node and esophageal endoscopy and dilation .\\nHISTORY AND REASON FOR ADMISSION :\\nThis is a 69 year-old white male status post surgery in July of 1993 for a laryngopharyngoesophagogastrectomy with gastric reconstruction and modified right neck dissection for pharyngeal cancer .\\nSince that surgery , the patient has had dysphagia off and on , solids worse than liquids .\\nSometimes solids get stuck for about 10 minutes .\\nAbout two months ago the patient had come to the emergency room because he couldn 't swallow for three days .\\nHe required esophageal dilation .\\nAlso , since July the patient has noted bilateral lymphadenopathy , especially the large submandibular , which has gotten larger .\\nIt is difficult to get an exact history as to the onset of the lymphadenopathy , as the patient cannot vocalize and is intoxicated at the time of admission .\\nThe lymphadenopathy is uncomfortable but not painful .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nSignificant for radiation therapy after his surgery in July , a tracheoesophageal fistula , which was repaired , exploratory laparotomy in November , 1994 , for small bowel obstruction , hypertension , colitis , neonatal jaundice , and on September 1 , 1993 , drainage of a neck abscess .\\nHe underwent closure of pharyngeal cutaneous fistula with muscle interposition on November 5 , 1994 , and a left upper lobectomy in September , 1993 , for lung cancer .\\nALLERGIES :\\nAspirin .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nNone .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nNotable for heavy alcohol use and history of heavy tobacco use , although he quit two years ago .\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS :\\nNo fevers or chills , no nightsweats .\\nPositive weight gain since his last admission , positive diarrhea times two weeks-soft brown stools .\\nNegative bright red blood per rectum , negative coughing , negative hemoptysis , negative hematemesis , negative chest pain , positive shortness of breath with exertion .\\nThe patient can walk or go up a flight of stairs without any shortness of breath , however .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nThe patient was a pleasant , mildly intoxicated male with grossly swollen

.\\nHeart :\\nregular rate and rhythm .\\nThe abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended , positive bowel sounds .\\nExtremities without clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN :\\nThis 69 year-old male status post laryngopharyngo-esophagogastrectomy for cancer in 05/93 now represents with progressive dysphagia and gross lymphadenopathy and neck mass .\\nThe patient is mildly intoxicated .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was given overnight hydration .\\nHe was taken to the operating room on May 14 , 1994 , for a bronchoscopy and esophagoscopy , dilatation and biopsy .\\nHis left neck mass was excised and preliminarily was said to be squamous cell carcinoma .\\nThe patient had esophagoscopy , where a stenosis was noted which was dilated to a # 49 French catheter .\\nThere were no complications .\\nThe patient was taken to the floor in stable condition .\\nPostoperatively , there was no crepitus and X-rays showed no mediastinal air .\\nNeck biopsy site was clean .\\nOn May 15 , the patient 's diet was advanced to a soft diet and then later in the day to a regular diet .\\nRadiation Oncology was consulted and it was determined that Mr. Douet still had room for more palliative radiation therapy of his neck , and he arranged an appointment with Dr. Wires on Tuesday following discharge .\\nDr. Wires 's telephone number is 526-6508 .\\nOn May 16 , the patient was tolerating PO well , his lungs were clear , and he was discharged to home in stable condition .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nNone .\\nFOLLOW-UP :\\nThe patient will follow up with Dr.

child and a heart murmur noted but no further testing .\\nShe has used antibiotic prophylaxis since 1980 .\\nIn 1980 she had quadruple coronary artery bypass graft surgery by Dr. Elks at Feargunwake Otacaa Community Hospital and did well until 1988 when she had exertional angina and a positive stress test and found that three or four grafts were occluded .\\nIn October , 1989 , Dr. No re-did her bypass operation .\\nShe had a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 1 and a saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 2 .\\nIn 1993 she had a DDD pacemaker for complete heart block .\\nShe had exertional angina at that time .\\nIn November , 1997 she had a small myocardial infarction as was transferred to Ona Hospital where a cardiac catheterization showed a tight left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending stenosis , high grade saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal 1 stenosis and patent obtuse marginal 2 graft .\\nShe had normal left ventricular function with apical tip akinesis .\\nSince that time she has continued to have exertional left chest burning , radiating to the left neck and arm , relieved by nitroglycerin .\\nShe was turned down for re-do surgery at that time and did not have a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty .\\nBecause these symptoms have been increasing , particularly at cardiac rehabilitation , she was referred here .\\nIn May , 1998 she had an exercise tolerance test in which her heart rate went to 112 and her blood pressure fell to 95 systolic .\\nShe had diffuse ischemic ST segment changes and increased lung uptake and a reversible anterior and lateral defect .\\nShe has had no syncope .\\nHer cardiac risk factors are hypertension and elevated cholesterol .\\nShe has a very strong family history of coronary artery disease with a mother , sister and brother dying of myocardial infarction .\\nShe is a remote cigarette smoker .\\nShe also has a history of lactose intolerance , peptic ulcer disease , with a remote gastrointestinal bleed and multiple ectopic pregnancies and mid term miscarriages .\\nShe has had a total abdominal hysterectomy .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nShe is a widow for 20 years and retired 18 years from Palmci\\nShe lives alone .\\nHer son , Nertland is nearby and he works at the Em Nysonken Medical Center on Verville .\\nThey live in Ohio .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nShe is a healthy appearing female , 5 foot 120 pounds .\\nHer blood pressure was 120/70 , pulse 60 and regular .\\nNeck veins are not distended .\\nRespiratory rate 12 .\\nCarotids :\\nno bruits .\\nLungs were clear .\\nCardiac :\\n1/6 systolic ejection murmur .\\nAbdomen was benign .\\nPeripheral pulses intact .\\nNeurological examination non-focal .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nOn admission , includes an electrocardiogram that shows DDD pacing .\\nHematocrit 39 percent , white blood cell count 4500 , PT and PTT normal .\\nSodium 140 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 105 , carbon dioxide 30 , BUN 24 , creatinine 1.0 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\\nThe patient was admitted to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory .\\nThere , her pulmonary wedge pressure was 12 and her right atrial pressure was 4 and pulmonary artery pressure 44/17 .\\nHer left ventricular contraction showed akinesis of the anterior wall with dyskinesis of the apex .\\nShe had preserved inferior contraction and basal contraction .\\nHer native right and left anterior descending vessels were occluded as was an obtuse marginal branch .\\nThe saphenous vein to the high diagonal or high obtuse marginal was occluded .\\nThe left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending was also occluded .\\nThe saphenous vein graft to the second obtuse marginal was open with no significant stenosis , but there was an outflow lesion in the obtuse marginal 2 as well as severe distal lesion as the obtuse marginal 2 fed the posterior descending artery .\\nThis was considered her culprit lesion .\\nThis was considered too high risk for angioplasty because of the severe disease in the graft .\\nIn addition , it was noted that she had saphenous vein harvested from both thighs .\\nHer left internal mammary artery was also unused .\\nIt was also noted that she had failure to sense with the atrial lead .\\nShe would not sense the atrial contraction and the fire and this occasionally led to competition of firing .\\nThis was intermittent .\\nThe P wave amplitude was .6 and this could not be totally sensed .\\nThe patient was admitted for management of her coronary artery disease and evaluation of her pacemaker .\\nIt was noted that she became very symptomatic when she was not on a beta blocker but that on a beta blocker she had significant pacemaker failure .\\nHer pacemaker was set to a VVI mode which sensed appropriately .\\nShe was in sinus rhythm with most of the time .\\nWhen her pacemaker was in a sinus rhythm without a beta blocker , she had significant angina .\\nCarotid non-invasive testing was unremarkable .\\nThe situation was reviewed with Dr. Niste Graft .\\nHe felt the patient was not a coronary artery bypass graft candidate because of the lack of conduit and because of the presence of a large anterior myocardial infarction .\\nFor this reason , it was decided to maximize her beta blockers and nitrates .\\nThe situation was reviewed with Dr. No of the Pacemaker Service .\\nOn August 20 , under local anesthesia the right pectoral region was explored and the leads disconnected and the pulse generator changed to a CPI unit in which the sensitivity could be adjusted to .15 mm. , which permitted appropriate atrial sensing .\\nThere was nothing wrong with the prior generator and nothing

Digoxin 0.25 mg qd ; aspirin 325 mg qd ; Isordil 10 mg tid .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nMr. Breun underwent a six vessel coronary artery bypass grafting procedure in March , 1990 , following a complicated inferior posterior myocardial infarction .\\nHe had a very stormy course , dominated by post infarction angina pectoris , high grade atrial ventricular block , gastrointestinal bleeding , pneumonia , and no noliguric renal failure .\\nAn intra-aortic balloon pump was required for stabilization .\\nHe also had moderately severe aortic stenosis at that time with a peak aortic valve gradient of 30 , and a calculated valve area of 1.2 cm squared .\\nDespite the magnitude of these problems , he made a remarkable recovery over the course of several months , and was able to return to work on a part-time basis , after joining a program of cardiac rehabilitation .\\nPostoperatively , we measured a left ventricle ejection fraction of 40% , by gated cardiac blood pool scanning .\\nOver these past 3 years , he has remained stable , on a very simple program of aspirin , and Atenolol .\\nHe returned for routine office evaluation on 3/25/93 , complaining of 2 months of progressive exertional dyspnea , with occasional chest discomfort , and , more recently , orthopnea , cough , peripheral edema , and weight gain .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nWeight 197 lbs , up 6 lbs , blood pressure 128/88 , heart rate 70 and regular .\\nThe venous pressure was markedly elevated to 15 cm .\\nThe carotids were of low volume , and sluggish bilaterally , with transmission of a basal heart murmur .\\nThere was dullness at both bases , with rales 1/3 way upon the right , and at the base on the left .\\nThe right ventricle , and left ventricle impulses were diffuse .\\nThere was a Grade I-II murmur of aortic stenosis , with additional murmurs of tricuspid , and mitral regurgitation , and an obvious S3 .\\nThe liver was enlarged 2 finger breadths below the right costal margin , and there was 1-2+ peripheral edema .\\nHis chest X-ray demonstrated cardiomegaly , with bilateral pleural effusions , right greater than left , and pulmonary vascular re-distribution .\\nThe electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with first degree AV block , an old inferior myocardial infarction , and old anteroseptal myocardial infarction , and non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities , that were unchanged compared to June , 1992 .\\nLater , an echocardiogram on 3/27/93 , demonstrated mild mitral regurgitation with calcification of the annulus , and incomplete closure of the valve , consistent with papillary muscle dysfunction .\\nThe left atrium was dilated to 52 mm .\\nThe aortic valve was thickened , with restrictive motion , and there were indistinct mobile echo densities on the leaflets .\\nThere was evidence of trace aortic regurgitation , however , due to technical difficulties , accurate gradients could not be estimated .\\nThe left ventricle was dilated , with concentric hypertrophy , and multi segmental wall motion abnormalities , with a reduced ejection fraction of 24% .\\nThere was also Doppler evidence of tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary insufficiency .\\nA Persantine Thallium scan on 3/31/93 , showed increased lung uptake , cavity dilatation and a large inferior , apical scar , without evidence of active ischemia .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\npotassium 4.4 , BUN and creatinine 33/1.7 , albumen 3.6 , total bilirubin 1.8 , direct bilirubin 0.5 , CK 162 , with 11.1 MB for a relative index of 6.9% .\\nThis was of uncertain significance .\\nThe hematocrit 43.2 , whiteblood count 9.2 , prothrombin time 10.4 , partial thromboplastin time 34.2 , urinalysis had 1+ albumen and 0-2 white blood cells , per high power field , with a culture that demonstrated rare Enterococcus .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to the Medical Service , and placed at bed rest , and given intravenous Furosemide .\\nOver the course of the next few days , we succeeded in having his weight decrease from its value of 189 lbs , to as low as 177 1/2 lbs .\\nCoincident with this , his clinical condition improved markedly , and he became fully ambulatory .\\nGiven the difficulties in trying to assess the exact mechanism by which his heart failure had occurred , we proceeded to cardiac catheterization on 4/1/93 .\\nAt the time of this study , the right atrial pressure was 1 , the PA pressure 32/10 , and the mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 10 .\\nThere was a 40-50 mm peak to peak gradient across the aortic valve , a mean gradient of 40 , and a calculated valve area of 0.5 cm squared , using a cardiac output of 3.4 liters per minute .\\nLeft ventriculography demonstrated marked left ventricle dilatation .\\nThere was mild mitral regurgitation , a posterior basil aneurysm , and akinesis of the apex , septum , and inferior walls .\\nThe anterior lateral wall was severely hypokinetic , and the posterior lateral wall moderately kinetic .\\nThe aortic valve was calcified with reduced excursion consistent with his aortic stenosis .\\nA dominant right coronary artery had an 80% proximal stenosis , and was then occluded at the acute margin .\\nA large right ventricular marginal branch did fill the saphenous vein graft in a retrograde fashion .\\nThe posterior descending artery had an 80% stenosis proximal to the insertion of the graft .\\nThe left anterior descending was proximally occluded , and the left circumflex had a 90% stenosis in the first marginal branch , and 90% stenosis distally in other branches .\\nThe saphenous vein graft to the right ventricular acute marginal and posterior descending artery was patent with good runoff .\\nThe saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending had a minor plaque at the distal anastomosis .\\nThe saphenous vein graft to three distal marginal branches was patent with good flow .\\nCertainly , the cardiac catheterization was consistent with severe aortic stenosis in the presence of profound left ventricular systolic dysfunction .\\nThese findings were reviewed with Dr. Patella and together we decided that conservative therapy would be the appropriate first choice in Mr. Breun 's management .\\nHis advanced age , prior cardiac surgery and advanced left ventricular dysfunction , together with his chronic renal insufficiency , would certainly complicate to an enormous degree any undertaking as risky as redo surgery for aortic valve replacement .\\nPercutaneous aortic valvuloplasty , on the other hand , would only be a temporary procedure and did not seem necessary even for transient symptomatic relief given his marked improvement following a rather conventional course of intravenous diuretics .\\nIt is very unlikely that we will offer Mr. Breun aortic valve replacement surgery in the future .\\nHe seems to agree with this particular approach as the quality of life has become very important and appropriate issue for him .\\nHe is looking forward to returning home and going back to work on a part time basis at the local pharmacy .\\nWe will see how far we can get with medical therapy although Mr. Wierst and his family clearly understand the long term implications of his aortic stenosis .\\nETHELAN KOTEFYFECHIRD , M.D.\\nTR :\\ngo / bmot\\nDD :\\n4/4/93\\nTD :\\n04/06/93\\nCC :\\n[

been under the care of Dr. Aalv Manual and was referred here for further therapy .\\nShe had no prior significant cardiac history and presented to her local medical doctor 's office with an episode of severe retrosternal chest pain .\\nHer electrocardiogram showed a new right bundle branch block and left anterior hemiblock .\\nThe patient was transferred to the Gemenadentoolpai Medical Center and was admitted .\\nHer hospital course was remarkable for ruling in for a myocardial infarction with a peak CPK of 9,379 units with a 5.9% MB fraction .\\nIn addition , on telemetry she developed complete heart block and hypotension requiring temporary pacing wire and then a permanent pacemaker implantation on 08-03-93 .\\nShe developed congestive heart failure and required pressor support .\\nShe underwent cardiac catheterization on 8-15-93 and was found to have a left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 28 millimeters of mercury .\\nShe had a dominant right coronary artery with minor disease .\\nThe main left coronary artery had a 20% stenosis .\\nThe left anterior descending had a severe 80% proximal stenosis with a filling defect consistent with intraluminal thrombus .\\nThe circumflex artery had a minor 40% stenosis .\\nCine left ventriculogram revealed a dilated left ventricle with an area of anterolateral , apical , and septal akinesis .\\nThe left ventricular ejection fraction was estimated to 38% .\\nThe patient was transferred to the Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center for consideration of coronary angioplasty .\\nCARDIAC RISK FACTORS :\\nHer risk factors for coronary artery disease included a positive family history and an elevated cholesterol level .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nHer past medical history is remarkable for a history of Parkinson 's disease .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nHer physical examination at the time of admission revealed a pleasant lady in no acute distress .\\nThe blood pressure was 120/70 millimeters of mercury .\\nHer pulse was regular at 80 beats per minute .\\nThe jugular venous pressure was elevated at 6 cm above the sternal angle .\\nThe carotids were normal .\\nThe chest was clear .\\nThe cardiac examination revealed anapical impulse in the fifth left intercostal space , left to mid clavicular line .\\nThe first sound was normal .\\nThe second sound was normally split .\\nShe had no murmurs and no gallops .\\nThe examination the abdomen was benign .\\nThe examination of the extremities showed no edema .\\nShe had good pulses bilaterally .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nHer electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm , left atrial enlargement , left axis deviation , poor R-wave progression in V1 through V4 , consistent with marked clockwise rotation , cannot rule out an old anteroseptal wall myocardial infarction .\\nThere were prominent Q-waves in AVL , consistent with lateral myocardial infarction .\\nThere were non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to the Medical Service .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Department because of the history of Parkinson 's disease .\\nThe patient was maintained on intravenous heparin .\\nOn 8-17-93 , she was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where she underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the proximal left anterior descending .\\nFollowing balloon angioplasty , there was a local dissection with evidence of intraluminal thrombus , with a greater than 10% loss in the initial gain following coronary angioplasty .\\nTherefore , directional coronary atherectomy was performed with an excellent angiographic outcome , and a less than 10% residual narrowing .\\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well .\\nShe was maintained on intravenous heparin and was brought back to the cardiac catheterization laboratory on 08-18-93 for a relook coronary angiography .\\nCoronary angiography demonstrated ongoing benefit of the initial coronary atherectomy .\\nSpecifically , there was no decrease in the initial gain that she achieved after directional atherectomy .\\nThe patient remained stable during the rest of the hospitalization .\\nShe was transferred in stable condition to the Pasi for further rehabilitation therapy .\\nRENLAN FYFEZEIS , M.D.\\nDr. Aalv Lorjes Salv Manual Pasi\\nTR :\\njb / bmot\\nDD :\\n9-17-93\\nTD

.\\nShe had a minimally invasive single vessel coronary artery bypass graft in 1998 , consisting of a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending .\\nIn 03/09 , she was admitted to Abrat Hospital with a myocardial infarction , complicated by cardiogenic shock .\\nShe had cardiac catheretization at that time , which revealed patent left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending , a dominant left circumflex artery , with an 80% stenosis and a patent right coronary artery .\\nShe underwent Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent placement to the left circumflex artery .\\nOn 10/30/02 she presented to the Abrat Hospital again , with acute onset of shortness of breath while at rest , without other associated symptoms .\\nShe was diuresed and underwent cardiac catheterization , reported as a 90% right coronary artery stenosis , 100% native left anterior descending , patent left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending , sclerotiic distal LAD , 80% mid left circumflex stenosis ; posterior descending artery of 40% and 80% sequentially .\\nEchocardiogram at Abrat Hospital showed left ventricular wall motion abnormalities with anteroapical aneurysm , EF of 20% , mild left atrial dilatation , aorticsclerosis and mild pulmonary hypertension .\\nShe was transferred to Bri Health for Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty , plus / minus brachy therapy .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nThis is a 79 year old female , with acute distress .\\nBLOOD PRESSURE 110/60 , heart rate 60 , irregular .\\nO2 hemostasis of 97% , neurological awake , alert and oriented x three but poor short term memory and mild confusion .\\nHEENT - PERRLA , EOMI .\\nNeck was soft and supple .\\nJVP flat .\\nChest clear to auscultation bilaterally with mildly diminished breath sounds at the bases .\\nS1 , S2 , without murmurs , rubs or gallops .\\nAbdomen soft , with positive bowel sounds .\\nNo bruits audible .\\nLower

WBC 8.5 , hematocrit 34.5 , hemoglobin 11.2 , platelets 289 .\\nPT 13.7 / PTT 26.3 .\\nECG revealed atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\\nThis patent was admitted to Memasound Honvanta Hospital .\\nOn 11/8/02 she underwent a Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the left circumflex in stent restenosis with a 3.0 x 10.0 cutting balloon and then underwent Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the distal left circumflex lesion , followed by deployment of the 2.0 x 13.0 mm Pixel stent .\\nFollowing post deployment inflation , the vessel was at full volume without clot or dissection , and TIMI 3 flow .\\nShe was maintained on Integrilin for 12 hours ; her sheaths were removed without difficulty .\\nAfter sheath removal , she was started on Fragmin in anticipation of maintaining anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation .\\nShe felt right leg weakness during the procedure , but experienced a great deal of difficulty the following morning , ambulating to the bathroom due to this weakness , which resolved after 2-3 hours .\\nShe was seen in consultation by Neurology .\\nShe underwent head CT which showed old lacunes and bilateral basal ganglia and ? of small hypodensity in the left frontal lobe .\\nMRI was recommended , and on 11/12 she underwent an MRI which revealed an acute infarct in the left posterior corona radiata and narrowing at the P2 segment of the right PCA .\\nAfter her right lower extremity weakness resolved , she was able to stand but was resistant to walking .\\nThroughout the hospitalization she remained fatigued and lethargic , resisting mobilization .\\nShe had no further neurologic symptoms .\\nPost cath she developed contrast induced acute renal failure , with peak creat of 2.3 .\\nShe was seen in consultation by the Renal service who followed along closely .\\nEventually she had renal MRA which was reported as showing severe right renal artery stenosis .\\nIn order to evaluate this , on 10/21 she underwent renal MRA which showed only moderate right renal artery stenosis that was non-obstructive .\\nFollowing the initial catheterization , her hematocrit dropped to 26.5 .\\nShe underwent abdominal CT which was negative for retroperitoneal bleed .\\nThere was no evidence of GI bleeding , she was transfused one unit prbcs with improvement .\\nShe was seen in consultation by the EPS service at the request of family for evaluation of a biventricular pacemaker to improve her quality of life , however she was found not eligible due to a QRS duration less than 0.14 seconds , a right bundle branch configuration , left ventricular aneurysm , and finally an echocardiogram that showed improvement in the left ventricular function , to an EF of 46% .\\nThis echo cardiogram continued to show the apical aneurysm .\\nShe was seen in consultation by PT , to evaluate both her deconditioning and her safety risk in terms of long term anticoagulation .\\nShe was found to have a 4 x normal risk of falling , which was felt to be significant .\\nShe however is at increased risk for further embolic phenomenon with atrial fibrillation .\\nShe was maintained on Fragmin and will be considered for lowdose Coumadin once the Plavix is finished in a month if her gait and strength have improved .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nShe is ready for discharge to a nursing facility for further strength training .\\nATA SINGLE , N.P.\\nDICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed\\nSHONDMAGSHAO ANDLI SINGLE ,

OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nMr. Breutzfarstxei is a 30 year old man with recently diagnosed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia who presented with pneumonia , developed adult respiratory distress syndrome , and died in the hospital after failed efforts of ventilatory support .\\nMr. Breutzfarstxei was recently diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome when he had Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia on 01/17/91 .\\nHe was admitted to the Retelk County Medical Center at that time and was treated with Bactrim and steroids .\\nHe was actually intubated and underwent bronchoscopy where the diagnosis was made with a positive toluidine blue study .\\nHe initially did well after extubation and completed approximately two weeks of Bactrim and a steroid taper .\\nAt discharge after about two weeks post-extubation , he had an O2 saturation of approximately 95% on room air .\\nHe was seen by Dr. Seen and Dr. Seen as an out-patient .\\nOn 02/06/91 , he was seen in FLFDMC and at that point , his temperature was noted to be 101.4 and he had malaise and diarrhea .\\nHe was evaluated in the Emergency Room .\\nAt that time , his oxygen saturation was only 90% on room air and his chest X-Ray showed no change .\\nCultures were taken and he was sent out .\\nOn 02/08/91 , the patient called Dr. Seen because of increased shortness of breath and malaise .\\nHe was seen in FLFDMC where he was noted to have jaundice and newly palpable liver edge .\\nReview of liver function tests revealed a cholestatic picture which was not previously found and it was felt that this was secondary to the Bactrim which had been recently stopped anyway .\\nHis oxygen saturation at that time was only 86% on room air and he was admitted .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1) HIV positive with a CD4 count of 74 .\\n2) Recent PCP .\\n3) Status post right elbow surgery .\\n4) Venereal disease history .\\n5) PPD anergic .\\nThe patient 's HIV risk factors include history of intravenous drug abuse , prostitution , and a former prisoner .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn presentation , the patient was a young appearing Hispanic male in mild respiratory distress with a blood pressure of 140/90 , heart rate 120 , respirations 32 , and temperature 101 .\\nSKIN :\\nJaundiced .\\nHEENT :\\nRevealed icteric sclerae , the oropharynx with extensive thrush , and an ulcer under his tongue .\\nNECK :\\nHe had no cervical adenopathy and his neck was supple .\\nLUNGS :\\nHad tubular breath sounds especially in the lower lung fields .\\nCARDIAC :\\nShowed regular rate and rhythm without murmurs , rubs , or gallops .\\nThere was no costovertebral angle tenderness .\\nABDOMEN :\\nSoft with bowel sounds and there was mid epigastric and right upper quadrant tenderness .\\nHis liver was 10 cm and was felt three finger breadths below the costal margin .\\nHis spleen was not palpable .\\nRECTAL :\\nHe had guaiac positive stools .\\nEXTREMITIES :\\nUnremarkable .\\nGENITOURINARY :\\nHis penis had a 1/2 cm ulcer with yellowish discharge .\\nNEUROLOGICAL :\\nNon-focal .\\nLABORATORY EXAMINATION :\\nOn admission , white count was 7.2 with 57% neutrophils , 40% lymphocytes , l mononuclear cell , and 1.6 eosinophils .\\nPT was 12.6 and PTT was 29 .\\nSodium was 133 , potassium was 4.2 , chloride 100 , CO2 19 , BUN 21 , creatinine 1.2 , and glucose 122 .\\nALT was 181 , AST was 156 , LDH was 336 , alkaline phosphatase was 214 , and bilirubin was 12.7 total .\\n( On 02/06 , his bilirubin had been 7.2 with 6 direct ) .\\nHis arterial blood gas on 50% was pO2 92 , pCO2 24 , and pH 7.46 .\\nHis chest X-Ray showed bilateral nodular infiltrates .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted for work-up of his cholestatic jaundice picture along with work-up for his pulmonary process and treatment of both .\\nIn terms of pulmonary function , it was felt that one possibility was that the patient was a Bactrim failure for PCP although this was unusual .\\nHe was started on Pentamidine , especially in light of the fact that it was felt that his liver function tests were due possibly to Bactrim .\\nThe patient was also covered with Erythromycin and Gentamicin for coverage of community acquired pneumonias and gram negative rods .\\nHe was given supplemental oxygen .\\nIn terms of his liver abnormalities , it was felt that viral hepatitis was in the differential as well as several opportunistic infections of the liver but also was felt that Bactrim could be a cause of these abnormalities .\\nTiters for CMV and Epstein-Barr virus were sent and a titer for toxoplasma was sent .\\nStool was sent for ova and parasites .\\nGastrointestinal was consulted .\\nInitially , the patient did well in terms of his pre-status and required less oxygen .\\nHowever , on 02/10/91 , his respiratory rate increased and his oxygen saturation decreased .\\nActually in reviewing the records at this point , it appears that Pentamidine was not started initially so on the antibiotics of Erythromycin and Gentamicin , the patient 's respiratory status worsened and his LDH climbed so he began Pentamidine on 02/10/91 .\\nOn 02/11/91 , the patient again appeared more comfortable this time with 50% facemask but then required more oxygen , dropped his O2 saturations , and was intubated on 02/11/91 .\\nHe was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on 12/12/90 on Gentamicin , Vancomycin , Pentamidine , and Prednisone .\\nAlso of note at that point , hepatitis C virus serologies had come back positive .\\nHowever , at this point , his liver function test abnormalities appeared more consistent with a cholestatic picture with his direct bilirubin being 12.1 and total being 14.1 .\\nThe patient 's abdominal CT scan showed no liver disease and no obstruction .\\nThe patient 's liver function tests appeared to improve .\\nThe patient 's penile ulcer was cultured and grew positive herpes simplex virus and the patient was started on Acyclovir .\\nOn 02/13/91 , the patient had a bronchoalveolar lavage performed which showed a toluidine blue with many pneumocysts noted .\\nNo other cultures grew out and the patient 's clinical status deteriorated .\\nThe patient required 100% oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturations on the ventilator .\\nHe required elevated ventilatory pressures with PIPS often above 60 .\\nFortunately , no evidence of baratroma was ever discerned .\\nHowever , the patient 's respiratory status continued to decline and we were unable to maintain oxygen saturations above 80% even using reverse I to E ventilation , paralysis , sedation , and other modes of ventilation .\\nPatient underwent liver biopsy on 02/16/91 and the results of this were pending when the patient died .\\nThe patient actually developed decreasing counts with white count as low as 1.75 , hematocrit as low as 26 , and platelets as low as 68 noted on 02/15/91 .\\nThese were supported with blood products and Hematology was consulted .\\nThey felt that it was most likely secondary to Bactrim and these actually were getting better when the patient died .\\nBone marrow biopsy was not attempted .\\nDiscussions were begun with the family regarding limits of supportive care .\\nDue to continued worsening pulmonary status and an overall grim prognosis , the family decided , in consultation with the Medical Team , to withdraw ventilatory support .\\nThis was done on the evening of 02/18/91 .\\nPatient expired after the endotracheal tube was withdrawn at 6:40 p.m.\\nDISPOSITION :\\nThe patient died in hospital .\\nAn autopsy will be performed .\\nAn autopsy was performed as per the family 's wishes .\\nWE221/9850 TAKO C.

.\\nWORD DISABILITY AND PROBABLY DURATION :\\nThe patient is disabled .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nMs. Kotereef is a 93-year-old woman who was transferred from Daleglo Medical Center with renal insufficiency .\\nThe patient was in her usual state of health until 7/10/98 when she was admitted to the Daleglo Medical Center with a chief complaint of falling and mental status changes .\\nShe was initially treated for heart failure and pneumonia and , on the night of admission , she experienced a fever to 104 , acute respiratory distress and required intubation for two days .\\nThe patient was noted to have a CPK of 150 with 11.8 percent MB but no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes .\\nShe was treated for congestive heart failure and was diuresed and extubated .\\nShe was transferred to the floor where initially she did very well but subsequently developed an elevated BUN and creatinine and failure to eat .\\nThe patient 's granddaughter requested that she be transferred to the Ph University Of Medical Center where she had been cared for in the past for her myocardial infarction as well as cerebrovascular disease .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nHer past medical history is notable for congestive heart failure with a last ejection fraction noted to be 28 percent in April of 1997 .\\nShe also has a history of urinary tract infection .\\nShe has a history of diverticulosis with lower GI bleeds .\\nIn 01/95 she was admitted with a cerebral vascular accident notable for right facial droop and left-sided weakness .\\nThere was marked improvement in these symptoms thereafter , and the patient was discharged on Coumadin which was subsequently discontinued .\\nThe patient also has a history of myocardial infarction in 1977 and 1987 and underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting X4 in 1987 .\\nShe also has a history of polymyalgia rheumatica with a bilateral temporal artery being biopsied and being negative for temporal arteritis .\\nShe also has a history of right proximal femur fracture and internal fixation in 1995 .\\nOn arrival to the Ph University Of Medical Center the patient stated that she had not had a bowel movement for many days and that she had no appetite .\\nHowever , she denied any chest pain , dyspnea or syncope .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination her pulse was 55 .\\nHer systolic blood pressure was 110 .\\nShe appeared to be very dry with very dry mucosa .\\nHer lungs had few rhonchi , no rales .\\nHer cardiac exam was irregular but her heart sounds were distant .\\nHer abdomen showed active bowel sounds , was nontender and she had no pedal edema .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nLaboratory data was notable for hematocrit of 33.5 , white count of 14.7 , platelet count of 270 .\\nBUN 112 , creatinine 2.3 , sodium 142 , potassium 4.2 , CO2 23.4 , and chloride 104 .\\nA chest x-ray revealed clear lungs on a portable chest x-ray without evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema .\\nA KUB showed a large loop of dilated bowel but no free air and a tortuous calcified aorta .\\nAn electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with evidence of an old inferior myocardial infarction and right bundle branch block .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\\nThe patient was admitted to Goman 25 where she was hydrated for the presumed diagnosis of pre-renal azotemia .\\nA urinalysis was notable for pyuria with 50 to 100 white cells , and the patient was begun on Levofloxacin for presumed polymicrobial urinary tract infection .\\nA head CT scan was performed which showed multiple old ischemic infarcts in the right frontal and cerebellar lobes .\\nThere was diffuse atrophy and no evidence of recent bleed .\\nThe patient was evaluated by the rheumatology service who noted that the patient 's diagnosis was most consistent with rheumatoid arthritis and possibly PMR .\\nThe patient had been followed by Dr. Friednantflirt of the Ph University Of Medical Center .\\nAt that time she was noted to have undergone bilateral temporal artery biopsies , both of which were negative for temporal arteritis .\\nThe recommendation from the rheumatology service was to attempt to decrease her Prednisone to 5 mg PO q.day with an eye on a change in the severity of her shoulder arthritis symptoms .\\nOn the third hospital day the patient developed a sudden change in her mental status while taking pills .\\nShe was noted to be arousable and responsive and minimally conversation .\\nHowever , she was unable to move her right arm or leg .\\nHer eyes were deviated to the left and she had a right facial droop .\\nThe patient was taken to the emergent CAT scan which revealed no acute bleeding and was felt to be a cerebral vascular occlusion .\\nThe patient was evaluated by the Stroke Service , which recommended a lumbar puncture which was performed and did not reveal evidence of meningitis .\\nA cardiac ultrasound was performed which revealed an ejection fraction of 50 percent with wall motion abnormalities in the inferior septal and inferior walls involving the apex .\\nThere was trace mitral regurgitation .\\nMultiple aortic valve leaflets were thickened without stenosis .\\nThere was no evidence of an intraventricular thrombus .\\nThe patient was initially treated by increasing her aspirin from 81 mg to 325 mg .\\nShe was also continued to be hydrated .\\nHer blood pressure medications were held to allow increased cerebral perfusion .\\nAfter careful discussion with the neurology service , it was felt that the patient was at too great a risk to be started and maintained on anticoagulant therapy and therefore she was treated conservatively .\\nThe patient was subsequently evaluated by the speech pathology service , the physical therapy service and the occupational therapy service for evaluation for her recovery from her stroke .\\nHer BUN and creatinine continued to decrease with hydration and Zestril was re-initiated and , as her blood pressure allowed , her Isordil was re-initiated and then her Zestril was increased to 10 mg PO q.day .\\nDigoxin was discontinued because of her improved left ventricular ejection fraction .\\nThe patient did have a steady decrease in her hematocrit to a minimum of 26.2 and received one unit of packed red blood cells with restoration of her hematocrit over 30 .\\nHer ferritin was 83 and there was no evidence of guaiac positive stools .\\nIt was elected to defer further evaluation of her anemia at this time .\\nHowever , if she became more evidently guaiac positive it would be appropriate to evaluate the source of bleeding in her colon and potentially in her esophagus and stomach .\\nNevertheless , the patient was switched from aspirin to Plavix 75 mg PO q.day in view of her history of lower GI bleeding .\\nMajor consideration toward the end of the patient 's hospitalization was whether or not she would be able to take adequate PO intake to maintain her volume status .\\nInitially it was felt that the patient would require gastroscopy .\\nHowever , with the assistance of the patient 's granddaughter , the patient was able to increase her po intake with a lot of assistance .\\nThe patient 's granddaughter felt that it was likely that her PO intake would improve when she returned home to the nursing home .\\nI discussed this with the granddaughter and told her that if her PO intake was inadequate , that gastrostomy tube would be reasonable in the future and that we would be available to assist in this as it became necessary .\\nThe patient was evaluated by the GI service who thought that a PEG would be quite feasible and that they would be delighted to do this if it was necessary and the patient and family agreed .\\nNevertheless , we have decided to postpone this issue for now and to see how she does when she returns to the nursing home .\\nThe patient will be transferred tomorrow to Naplesvillechaelty .\\nI will get in touch with Dr. Areas and please do not hesitate to contact me if I can provide any additional information .\\nMy direct pager is 935-131-3314 .\\nTAMYRCLEO KOTE , M.D.\\nTR :\\ngqx\\nDD :\\n07/27/1999\\nTD :\\n07/27/1999 7:52 P\\ncc :\\nTAMYRCLEO NADON KOTE , M.D. RYNVI

diagnosed with cervical cancer in May of l989 .\\nShe was staged as lB and pathology showed a small cell neuroendocrine tumor of the cervix .\\nShe underwent a radical hysterectomy .\\nThere were positive margins and positive nodes .\\nin December of l990 , she had a vaginal apex mass on examination .\\nCystoscopy and proctoscopy were negative .\\nA CT , however , confirmed a large pelvic mass with bilateral hydronephrosis .\\nA biopsy of the mass revealed poorly differentiated metastatic small cell neuroendocrine tumor .\\nBetween March and May of l990 , she received two cycles of chemotherapy in two parts alternating Cisplatin and VP-l6 with Vincristine , Cytoxan , and Adriamycin .\\nIn June of l990 , she underwent radiation therapy and in July of l99l , a right ventriculogram showed an ejection fraction of 48% .\\nHer chemotherapy was then changed to a single agent of Cytoxan .\\nAlso in July of l99l , she had right hip pain .\\nThere was a bony metastasis .\\nOrthopedic Surgeons did an open reduction and internal fixation of a lytic lesion involving the right femur .\\nOn July 30 through August 4 of l99l , she received her first cycle of Ifosfamide and Mesna .\\nShe had prolonged neutropenia and on August 28 , she was admitted with a headache .\\nCT scan at that time was normal .\\nShe had non-focal findings per the Neurology Service .\\nOn September 6 , she began the next cycle of second line chemotherapy consisting of Carboplatin , Ifosfamide , and Mesna .\\nSince the last cycle of chemotherapy , she has had continued right hip pain and right mid lateral abdominal discomfort .\\nShe also had complaint of a left perineal rash over the last two weeks .\\nShe was started on Zovirax on October 3 .\\nShe presents for a bone scan , blood transfusion , and consideration of her third cycle of second line chemotherapy .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nAs above .\\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY :\\nRadical hysterectomy in May of l989 , open reduction and internal

count of 2.27 , with 56 polys and 3 bands .\\nHer hematocrit was 22.9 and platelets were l24 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted for bone scan and blood transfusion as well as consideration of further chemotherapy .\\nThe bone scan was performed which revealed multiple metastases to the spine , ribs , and skull .\\nThere was noted , however , to be new pain in the right shoulder and , in fact , there was a lytic lesion involving the right shoulder and femur .\\nPlain film revealed a moth-eaten appearance consistent with probable new metastases .\\nThe Radiation Service was consulted and noted that past areas treated including her right femur , her thoracic spine , pelvis , and right posterior ribs had all responded to radiation therapy and agreed that treating the right shoulder humerus and the right hip which had not been previously treated was reasonable .\\nPlanning for further radiation therapy was arranged for next week by the Radiation Service .\\nShe was also seen by the Dermatology Service who examined the rash and felt it was most likely a contact dermatitis .\\nShe was given Synalar Cream and Eucerin Cream as a moisturizer .\\nThe patient also received a unit of donor direct blood .\\nDue to Dr. Friednantflirt 's concern that the tumor was growing despite the available chemotherapeutic regimen , the Im Villtro University Medical Center Medical Oncology Service was consulted .\\nThey noted , as well , that she had failed the most active agents against small cell carcinomas .\\nHowever , they felt that at the Venbonlea Health , there were several possible options including a possible phase I trial regimen .\\nThe plan at this time was made to further consider the options and the patient will follow-up with

Total protein 7.2 , albumin 3.7 , calcium 9.3. PT and PTT were 13.3 and 23.5 respectively .\\nUA was negative with sediment , 4 to 5 white cells , 1 to 2 red cells , and 1+ bacteria .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nBy systems -\\n1) GI - The patient was admitted to the floor and underwent extraction of the piece of chicken from his esophagus later that afternoon .\\nExtraction was successful and foreign body was removed piecemeal .\\nEGD was performed .\\nSubsequently at the site where the chicken was stuck there was no notable trauma or lesion distal to the chicken .\\nThere was some gastritis and duodenitis but no frank ulcers .\\nThe patient was sent to the floor and GI wise was doing well until approximately 9/22/93 when he developed an ileus one day status post teeth extraction and general anesthesia .\\nThe patient also had a GI bleed at that time and an NG tube was placed with removal of 2500 cc of dark brown bilious guaiac positive fluid .\\nThe patient was stabilized with fluid and improved quickly from this status over the weekend and Hct has been stable since that time .\\nOther GI issues include the patient 's hypopharyngeal cancer which will be discussed below .\\n2) Oncology - The patient was diagnosed prior to this admission with hypopharyngeal cancer for which he was going to undergo external radiation therapy for .\\nBecause of the multiple complications and lack of nutrition and inability of the patient to swallow without aspirating it was felt that this should be delayed until he is under better nutritional status .\\n3) Feeding and nutrition - The patient was unable to eat any food or drink by mouth given that he demonstrated frank aspiration each time he attempted this including with soft solids and puree foods .\\nA swallowing study was performed which clearly demonstrated frank aspiration and poor swallowing mechanism by the patient .\\nSeveral NG tubes were placed and the patient kept pulling the NG tubes out because his mental status was not completely cleared .\\nThe patient was sustained on IV fluids with D10 and multivitamins , thiamine , and folate .\\nHe was kept NPO given his history of aspiration and further attempts were made to fee the patient and finally as the patient 's mental status cleared he was responsive to having an NG feeding tube placed with Jevity feeds started .\\nOther options were considered including a PEG placement as well as surgical placement of a gastrostomy tube , however , it was felt that less aggressive measures with an NG tube would be prudent at this juncture given the patient 's poor prognosis for the future .\\nThe family was involved in making decisions regarding the patient 's nutritional status and originally felt that IV fluids alone should be used , however , finally decided that some sort of feeding should be undertaken and the NG tube was the initial thought .\\nIt is felt that if the NG tube does not work out the patient may need to be reassessed for potential placement of a gastrostomy tube , however , it is felt by all parties involved that the aggressive end may also present significant risk to this patient given that an operative procedure may be dangerous and patient has shown significant desaturation and uncooperativeness with his first EGD on admission .\\n4) Pulmonary - The patient had a clear chest x-ray other than a right lower lobe opacity consistent with scarring vs. fat pad which has been chronic on admission .\\nThe patient was saturating well throughout the initial part of the stay until he had the upper GI bleed on 9/22/93 at which time he also had significant aspiration of vomitus and was considered to have a probable aspiration pneumonia but with vague findings on chest x-ray .\\nThe chest x-ray cleared rather rapidly and on the third day post aspiration was consistent with the original admission x-ray .\\nHowever , after aspiration given that the patient had a white count bump from under 10,000 to 16,000 it was felt that he should be started on antibiotics and he was started on Ceftriaxone and clindamycin for a total 10 day course for presumptive aspiration pneumonia .\\nThe patient was afebrile throughout this period and tolerated antibiotics well and pneumonia appeared to resolve .\\nNo organism was ever cultured out of the sputum .\\n5) GU - The patient was not entirely responsive to using urinal or the bathroom and at times was incontinent .\\nIt was thought that a Foley catheter would be most appropriate and he seemed to tolerate this well .\\nHe had at one point the possibility of UTI but he was asymptomatic and on rechecking the urine there was no sign of urinary tract infection .\\nThe patient continued to be asymptomatic .\\n6) Neurological - The patient originally was almost completely non-responsive at least to verbal command but as his hospital course progressed he became somewhat more alert and towards the end of his hospital course was much more alert and oriented usually only times two and was difficult .\\nThe patient was much more cooperative towards the end of his stay and much more appropriate , however , he did not seem to fully comprehend the fact that he had cancer and that he would not be able to swallow things by mouth .\\nThese issues were explained to him repeatedly , however , he did not appear to comprehend them from day to day .\\nPsychiatry evaluated the patient and felt that he was not competent to decide his own affairs .\\n7) Social issues - The wife had obtained health proxy prior to this admission and it was felt that since the patient was not competent to make decisions on his own the wife would make decisions regarding the health status and treatment of the patient .\\nIt was decided the patient 's code status would not be DNR , DNI .\\n8) Dental - The patient was noted to have very few teeth and it was noted that none appeared viable and it was felt that since he would be undergoing XRT in the future that his teeth should be removed to avoid radiation necrosis in the future when he received his XRT .\\nHe underwent extraction of all his teeth on 9/21/93 tolerating the procedure well initially but then developed the ileus as noted above and subsequently a GI bleed .\\nLaboratory data on discharge revealed SMA 7 with sodium 134 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 103 , CO2 24 , BUN 5 , and creatinine 0.9 which has been stable at 0.9 to 1.0 with glucose 96 .\\nCBC revealed Hct 30.7 which has been ranging from high of 29 to 31 over the last week .\\nThe white count was 7.5 , platelets 196 .\\nThe last PT and PTT on 09/26/93 were 13.4 and 27.3 with INR of 1.2 .\\nThe last UA and sedimentation revealed rare white blood cells but was otherwise negative and the culture revealed no growth on 09/27/93 .\\nThe patient had a chest x-ray which showed a few right upper lobe and one left upper lobe nodule and a follow-up chest x-ray on 09/27/93 showed resolution of these previous nodular shadows .\\nA faint nodule remained in the left upper lobe and it was felt that this is probably not any metastatic disease and not of concern , however , it was suggested that follow-up chest x-ray may be taken to insure that these densities resolve .\\nOPERATIVE PROCEDURES :\\nExtraction of all remaining teeth under general anesthesia on 9/21/93 .\\nCOMPLICATIONS :\\n1) Aspiration pneumonia .\\n2) GI bleed .\\n3) Ileus secondary to general anesthesia for above operation .\\nDISPOSITION :\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient is stable on discharge .\\nThe patient is to be transferred to Paw.ryfear Medical Center for further care including physical therapy , occupational therapy , and further nutritional support .\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\\nPepcid 20 mg po IV b.i.d. for history of gastritis and GI bleed , heparin 5000 units subcutaneous b.i.d. ( this may be discontinued as the patient becomes more mobile and active ) , tube feeds with Jevity at 75 cc / hour full strength-please check residuals .\\nFeeding tube should be flushed q4h with 20 to 30 cc of warm water to prevent clogging of feeding tube .\\nDictated By :\\nCAGHALA UINTEELE , M.D. SZ23\\nAttending :\\nLAYMIE MELLERNY SHOULDER , M.D. IN39 QC398/8032\\nBatch :\\n055\\nIndex No. CFFCLP030B\\nD :\\n10/05/93\\nT :\\n10/05/93\\nCC :\\n1.

however , no ischemia was seen .\\nAn echocardiogram was done .\\nThe echocardiogram showed terrible left ventricular function , with left ventricular aneurysm .\\nThe right ventricle appeared to be acceptable .\\nThe percutaneous drainage catheter continued to have high output .\\nThe fluid was sent for amylase , which came back 53,230 .\\nOn 4/28/95 , the patient had new onset of abdominal pain .\\nHis white count had bumped from 8.3 on admission to 18.5 , on 4/27 .\\nA computerized tomography scan of the abdomen was performed .\\nApproximately 100 cc.\\'s of thick brownish material was aspirated through the indwelling catheter .\\nThe computerized tomography scan showed the catheter tip in good position .\\nBecause of the patient \\'s deteriorating state , the patient was brought to the operating room on 4/28/95 .\\nAn exploratory laparotomy was performed .\\nThe splenic flexure had a purulent exudative process along the antimesenteric surface .\\nThus , the splenic flexure and a portion of the descending colon were resected .\\nThe patient underwent a left colectomy with end transverse colostomy , and oversewing of the descending colon .\\nDrainage of the pancreatic necrosis was also done .\\nThe patient tolerated the procedure fairly well , and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit .\\nIn the Intensive Care Unit , the patient had a prolonged course .\\nThe patient was then extubated on postoperative day #2 , but remained pressor-dependent .\\nHe remained on imipenem , and Vancomycin was also started .\\nThereafter , the patient had a long and complicated postoperative course .\\nHe was eventually transferred to the floor , where he remained meta-stable .\\nHe had repeated episodes of hypotension to 80-90 systolic/40-50 diastolic .\\nThese resolved without incident .\\nHe also had repeated temperature spikes .\\nAfter repeated work ups , it was felt that these were probably due to remaining infection in the peripancreatic area .\\nHis drainage tube from the peripancreatic area was gradually advanced , and eventually discontinued .\\nMr. Mass was placed on multiple courses of antibiotics .\\nMost recently , he was on a 28 day course of Vancomycin , ofloxacin , and Flagyl , for blood cultures that were positive for gram positive cocci and enteric and non-enteric gram negative rods .\\nThis 28 day course was completed on 07/15/95 .\\nThe patient was also treated initially with amphotericin-B and then with fluconazole for a computerized tomography guided aspirate of a small fluid collection around his pancreas , which grew Candida albicans .\\nThe patient also had several episodes of fungal cystitis with Torulopsis glabrata , going from his urine .\\nHe was treated with amphotericin-B bladder washes for this .\\nMr. Mass was initially anticoagulated for his left ventricular aneurysm .\\nHe remained stable from a cardiac fashion .\\nHe did have problems with po intake .\\nHe had repeated bouts of small-volume emesis that may have been secondary to reflux .\\nHe was treated with a variety of anti-emetics , most recently Granisetron , with only mild success .\\nHe remained total parenteral nutrition-dependent throughout his hospital course .\\nBy the end of June , it became clear that Mr. Mass would require aggressive surgical intervention in order to eradicate his intra-abdominal bursts of intermittent sepsis ; however , long discussions with the patient and his wife , who was his health-care proxy , revealed that they felt that no further aggressive intervention be attempted .\\nThe patient had been made a do not resuscitate do not intubate patient earlier in his hospital stay .\\nMultiple discussions were held between Dr. Mass , the rest of the surgical team , and the patient \\'s wife , with this same result .\\nAfter discussion with the patient \\'s primary doctor , Dr. Douet at Vassdiysey Medical Center , it was felt that the patient and his family would be best served if the patient were transferred to Vassdiysey Medical Center .\\nOf note , given the patient \\'s do not resuscitate status and the risk for bleeding , the patient \\'s Coumadin was stopped without incident several weeks before transfer .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :\\nMEDICATIONS :\\n1.

however , family declined aggressive cardiac intervention and opted for medical management only .\\nThus , the patient was admitted to the Medical Service for GI workup including possibly EGD .\\nOf note , the patient had a previously scheduled EGD for 03/17 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM :\\n1. Cardiovascular :\\nIschemia :\\nThe patient is status post a non ST elevation MI , a troponin peaked at 22 likely secondary to dehydration and presentation of acute renal failure .\\nThe patient was managed on a beta blocker .\\nAspirin was held second to his concurrent GI bleed .\\nPump :\\nThe patient was initially hydrated on exam ; however , the patient became euvolemic after transfusion of blood and _____ IV fluids .\\nOf note , the patient was transfused for a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells during this admission .\\nLasix was given after each unit of packed red blood cells .\\nRepeat echo revealed an EF of 45-50% with inferior and posterior basal hypokinesis .\\nOverall , the patient had preserved LV function despite a large troponin leak .\\nRate and rhythm :\\nThe patient with a history of afib .\\nAfib was stable .\\nCoumadin and aspirin are held again secondary to his concurrent GI bleed .\\n2. GI :\\nA GI consult was obtained and the patient had adequate IV access .\\nHematocrit was checked q.8h and the patient was transfused again , as noted above , a total of 4 units packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of less than 30 .\\nThe patient was started on Protonix IV 40 b.i.d.\\nPer GI consult given the patient 's non ST elevation MI he would be a high risk candidate for a GI endoscopy at this time and therefore in the peri non ST elevation MI period would prefer supportive management at this time with follow up including elective GI workup in 4-6 weeks .\\nThe patient continued to have guaiac positive stools but no evidence of bright red blood per rectum or large amounts of melena .\\nOn the date of discharge the patient has stools that are only trace guaiac positive .\\n3. Endocrine :\\nOn admission , all oral hyperglycemics were held and the patient was covered with regular insulin sliding scale q.a.c. and q.h.s.\\nThe patient 's fingersticks were in the 150s without any coverage .\\nThe patient was restarted on a low dose glipizide at 2.5 mg and adjustments to be made at the next PCP visit .\\n4. Heme :\\nHematocrit is stable .\\nHas remained stable above 30 without any need for further transfusions .\\nOver the last several days the patient received a total of 4 units packed red blood cells during this admission .\\nOn discharge his hematocrit is 35.4 .\\n5. ID :\\nThe patient was initially started on Levo 250 mg q.d. for a UTI .\\nHowever , his urine cultures were positive for MRSA and the patient completed a seven day course of Vancomycin IV .\\n6. Pulmonary :\\nThe patient with a history of MRSA left lower lobe pneumonia .\\nWe have a low threshold for starting antibiotics ; however , chest x-ray reveals no acute changes and the patient remained 96% on room air throughout this admission without any stigmata over recurrent pneumonia including cough , dyspnea or shortness of breath .\\n7. Renal :\\nThe patient came in with a creatinine that was elevated at 2.6 .\\nHis baseline was 1.8-2.2 likely pre renal azotemia and subsequently his creatinine improved with hydration and the packed red blood cell transfusions , and his creatinine steadily decreased down to his baseline .\\nOn discharge his creatinine is 1.8 .\\nCODE STATUS :\\nCode is DNR / DNI .\\nTO DO PLAN :\\n1. The patient is to follow up with PCP , Dr. Toob Obestimeuph in two weeks .\\n2. The patient is to follow up with the Genearocktemp Ry Health GI Service in four weeks .\\n3. The patient is deconditioned secondary to his week long hospital stay and long rehabilitation stay and will require aggressive physical therapy .\\n4. The patient should have q.o.d. hematocrit checks to ensure that his hematocrit is above 30 and if it is below 30 should be transfused secondary to his underlying known CAD .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nInclude Albuterol nebulizer 2.5 mg nebs q.4h , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Vitamin D 5000 units p.o. q.weekly , iron sulfate 325 mg p.o. t.i.d. , folate 1 mg p.o. q.d. , regular insulin sliding scale , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Neutrophos 250 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Senna 2 tablets p.o. b.i.d. , multivitamins with minerals one tab p.o. q.d. , trazadone 50 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. insomnia , Zocor 40 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Atrovent nebulizers 0.5 mg nebs q.i.d. p.r.n. shortness of breath , Pulmicort two puffs inhaled b.i.d. and Nexium 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.\\nDISPOSITION :\\nThe patient is to be discharged to rehabilitation for further recuperation and physical rehabilitation .\\neScription document :\\n9-4697302 KSRGeqm Tel\\nDicatated By :\\nLEICKKOTE , CI ABOB\\nAttending :\\nNORFJESCSTOOKS , SALENE MARGGAY Dictation ID 6114063\\nD :\\n03/21/04\\nT :\\n03/21/04\\n[ report_end ]\\n</TEXT>\", '<TEXT>\\n649008161\\nCTMC\\n07519742\\n1990961\\n8/24/2004 12:00:00 AM\\nhypoglycemia , RLL pneumonia\\nDIS\\nAdmission Date :\\n08/24/2004\\nReport Status :\\nDischarge Date :\\n08/29/2004\\n****** DISCHARGE ORDERS ******\\nCOND , TOILD 281-36-91-1 Z69\\nRoom :\\n16R-186\\nService :\\nMED\\nDISCHARGE PATIENT ON :\\n08/29/04 AT 12:00 M\\nCONTINGENT UPON\\nHome services\\nWILL D / C ORDER BE USED AS THE D / C SUMMARY :\\nYES\\nAttending :\\nFONG , CONEY N. , M.D.\\nCODE STATUS :\\nNo CPR / No defib / No intubation / No pressors /\\nDISPOSITION :\\nHome w/ services\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\\nECASA ( ASPIRIN ENTERIC COATED ) 81 MG PO QD COLACE ( DOCUSATE SODIUM ) 100 MG PO BID PROZAC ( FLUOXETINE HCL ) 60 MG PO QD\\nAlert overridden :\\nOverride added on 08/25/04 by BURHAYTH , MALICHARLEAR DIVERE , M.D.\\nPOTENTIALLY SERIOUS INTERACTION :\\nLEVOFLOXACIN and FLUOXETINE HCL\\nReason for override :\\nwill monitor FOLATE ( FOLIC ACID ) 5 MG PO TID\\nInstructions :\\nfrom investigational pharmacy\\nLOPID ( GEMFIBROZIL ) 600 MG PO BID Starting IN AM ( 08/25 )\\nOverride Notice :\\nOverride added on 08/25/04 by BURHAYTH , MALICHARLEAR DIVERE , M.D. on order for ZOCOR PO ( ref # 47460377 )\\nSERIOUS INTERACTION :\\nGEMFIBROZIL and SIMVASTATIN\\nPOTENTIALLY SERIOUS INTERACTION :\\nGEMFIBROZIL and SIMVASTATIN\\nReason for override :\\naware\\nZESTRIL ( LISINOPRIL ) 40 MG PO QD LOPRESSOR ( METOPROLOL TARTRATE ) 75 MG PO BID\\nHOLD IF :\\nsbp &lt; 100 , HR &lt; 55\\nFood / Drug Interaction Instruction\\nTake consistently with meals or on empty stomach .\\nMYSOLINE ( PRIMIDONE ) 50 MG PO QD INSULIN 70/30 ( HUMAN ) 12 UNITS SC QAM HOLD IF :\\nNPO\\nNumber of Doses Required ( approximate ) :\\n1\\nLEVOFLOXACIN 250 MG PO QD X 3 Days Starting Tomorrow ( 08/29 )\\nFood / Drug Interaction Instruction\\nAdminister iron products a minimum of 2 hours before or after a levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin dose dose If on tube feeds , please cycle ( hold 1 hr before to 2 hr after )\\nTake 2 hours before or 2 hours after dairy products .\\nOverride Notice :\\nOverride added on 08/25/04 by BURHAYTH , MALICHARLEAR DIVERE , M.D. on order for PROZAC PO ( ref 71481921 )\\nPOTENTIALLY SERIOUS INTERACTION :\\nLEVOFLOXACIN and FLUOXETINE HCL\\nReason for override : will monitor ATORVASTATIN 20 MG PO QD\\nAlert overridden :\\nOverride added on 08/28/04 by :\\nSERIOUS INTERACTION :\\nGEMFIBROZIL and ATORVASTATIN CALCIUM\\nPOTENTIALLY SERIOUS INTERACTION :\\nGEMFIBROZIL and ATORVASTATIN CALCIUM\\nReason for override :\\naware\\nPRILOSEC ( OMEPRAZOLE ) 20 MG PO QD LASIX ( FUROSEMIDE ) 20 MG PO QD\\nDIET :\\nHouse / ADA 2100 cals / day / Low saturated fat low cholesterol / Renal diet &lt; FDI &lt;\\nACTIVITY :\\nwalking only with walker\\nFOLLOW UP APPOINTMENT ( S ) :\\nMonaha Jesc as scheduled ,\\nALLERGY :\\nNKA\\nADMIT DIAGNOSIS :\\nsyncope\\nPRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS ; Responsible After Study for Causing Admission ) hypoglycemia , RLL pneumonia\\nOTHER DIAGNOSIS ; Conditions , Infections , Complications , affecting Treatment / Stay DM ( diabetes mellitus ) CRI ( chronic renal dysfunction ) HTN ( hypertension ) hypercholesterolemia ( elevated cholesterol ) elevated triglycerides ( elevated triglycerides ) prostate CA ( prostate cancer ) OA ( unspecified or generalized OA ) meniere \\'s dz ( menieres disease ) essential tremor ( tremor ) atypical chest pain ( atypical chest pain ) CAD ( coronary artery disease ) gout ( gout ) cva ( cerebrovascular accident ) pacemaker ( pacemaker ) PUD ( peptic ulcer disease ) UGIB ( upper GI bleeding)\\nOPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES :\\nOTHER TREATMENTS / PROCEDURES ( NOT IN O.R. )\\nnone\\nBRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE :\\n79M DM , CRI , Meniere \\'s , admitted for ?

DIAGNOSIS :\\nAcute myocardial infarction .\\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\\nurinary tract infection , congestive heart failure , Parkinson 's disease , chronic subarachnoid hemorrhage , history prostate cancer .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient presented to Ph University Of Medical Center with a fever .\\nThe patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of Parkinson 's disease x 's 18 years , prostate cancer , urinary incontinence and recent subdurals after fall .\\nHe reports lower abdominal pain x's 2 days .\\nOf note , he is a very poor historian given his difficulty speaking and inability to write from his Parkinson 's disease .\\nHis wife noted him to be restless on the day of admission , felt warm , temperature to 102.5 .\\nThey went to a local hospital where he was found to have a temperature of 102.4 and blood cultures were done and he was transferred to Ph University Of Medical Center for admission .\\nHe was recently started on a Texas catheter for urinary incontinence at home .\\nHe has no symptoms of shortness of breath , cough , diarrhea , nausea , vomiting , choking on food , no new medications .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nAs above .\\nMEDICATIONS ; On admission were Eldepryl , Artane , Prilodol , Sinemet and Opuputine .\\nALLERGIES :\\nHe had no known drug allergies .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\\nThe patient was admitted and started on Ampingent intravenously .\\nThere was a question of aspiration pneumonia so he was switched from Ampicillin pen-g to aspiration pneumonia .\\nHe was continued on his Parkinson 's medications .\\nA head CT was scheduled to rule out interval increase in subdurals .\\nHead CT results show full bilateral acute hemorrhage in his subdural hematomas , now with slight midline shift .\\nDr. Factor agreed he would review the CTs and follow the patient while in house .\\nHe was seen by urology , who suggested to leave the catheter in for now in the setting of doubt ms .\\nHe was seen by neuro , who felt that the subdural hemorrhages should be followed and treated conservatively as well as precautions for fall and no further intervention was warranted given risk of re-bleed which is quite high with his atrophic changes .\\nThe patient 's mental status improved greatly after the onset of intravenous antibiotics , doing much better , was much more awake and alert and the plan was to possibly send him home on po antibiotics and full Arnsperni Health services .\\nBedside swallow test was done which showed him to have some aspiration .\\nHe did have some recurrent fevers and his intravenous antibiotic were continued .\\nThus , he was considered ready for discharge .\\nHe again became much more somnolent , there was a question whether he had re-aspirated .\\nHe again was becoming increasing febrile and somnolent while the patient was awaiting a chest x-ray and further evaluation .\\nHe was switched over the Clinda and Gentamicin for his aspiration pneumonia and again his mental status improved .\\nOn 8/10/97 , the patient became unresponsive and apneic .\\nBrachial consult was obtained and the patient was intubated and transferred to the Intensive Care Unit .\\nHe was found to be profoundly hypoxic with sats down to 60% on 100% facemask .\\nHe was hypotensive into the 80s .\\nAn electrocardiogram showed evolving inferior q wave with increased ST segment and left anterior ST depressions .\\nRV leads were negative for ST elevation .\\nA chest x-ray showed marked congestive heart failure with increased heart size .\\nA portable echo showed no pericardial effusion and his left ventricle was severely diffusely hypokinetic with septal dyskinesis .\\nAnterior and inferior akinesis , apical akinesis to the posterior lateral wall moved slightly .\\nHe had about 20% mild mitral regurgitation .\\nThe right ventricle was markedly dilated with a kinetic free wall and very decreased function in a marked incomplete closure of the tricuspid valve with wide open tricuspid regurgitation .\\nHe was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for his acute myocardial infarction with very likely multi-vessel disease with concominent left anterior descending severe stenosis or likely left anterior descending with collateral circulation from that occluded right coronary artery .\\nThe patient was also evaluated by neurosurgery , given the difficult situation , the patient was not a candidate for streptokinase or tpa given his chronic subdurals with a recent new bleed .\\nHe was evaluated by neurosurgery , who felt that if heparin could be avoided , that would be best .\\nHe was treated conservatively with intubation , control of heart rate and on Dobutamine for pressure support .\\nHe was diuresed with Lasix and Diuril and was oxygenating fairly well while intubated .\\nHe surprisingly made it through the next 24 hours .\\nHe was dynamically stable on his Dobutamine with improved oxygenation .\\nThe patient continued fairly stable while intubated .\\nTwo days after the myocardial infarction he continued with stable blood pressure on a very small amount of Dobutamine .\\nHe had diuresed very well with good oxygenation .\\nHis neurostatus was indeterminate given his sedation on the ventilatory .\\nDiscussions with the family were ongoing regarding do not resuscitate and long term plan given his comorbidities .\\nThey were waiting appropriately for some information from the repeat echo after his myocardial infarction .\\nAn echo showed that there was not much improvement in cardiac function , both right or left ventriculus .\\nThey did at that time decide to make him do not resuscitate , but were interested in continuing supportive care to see how much he would bounce back .\\nThe repeat echo showed no improvement in left ventricle or right ventricle function with marked akinesis of many walls .\\nThe lack of meaningful recovery was much less likely .\\nDiscussions were had with the family regarding withdrawal of ventilator support , which they very appropriately decided on given the low possibility of any meaningful recovery .\\nHe was extubated successfully and was breathing comfortably on his own .\\nThe patient was transferred back to the medical floor in stable , but very guarded condition .\\nNo further blood draws were done .\\nThe patient was made comfortable on a low dose of intravenous Morphine with sectioning to prevent further aspiration .\\nComfort measures continued until the day 8/19/97 , where Mr. Koteleebdils was found to be pulseless , without respirations .\\nHe was declared dead at 7:15 a.m. on 8/19/97 .\\nThe family and the attending physician were notified .\\nLAURE MEDIATE , M.D.\\nTR :\\nlw\\nDD :\\n10/22/97\\nTD :\\n10/27/97 10:35 A\\ncc :\\nLAURE T

:\\nSigned\\nDischarge Date :\\n07/27/1996\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nMs. Rule is a 75 year old woman who is status post sigmoid resection for Duke 's C2 low sigmoid carcinoma admitted on 7/8/96 with abdominal pain and neutropenia .\\nShe first presented in April of 1990 with abdominal pain and ultimately was diagnosed with a Duke 's B2 tumor in her transverse colon and had a transverse colectomy with reanastomosis .\\nShe then represented in March of 1996 with rectal bleeding and was found to have a tumor 15 cm from the anal verge in the distal sigmoid colon .\\nShe underwent a sigmoid resection on 5/17/96 by Dr. Lenni Pain .\\nAt the time of surgery there was no evidence of liver disease .\\nPathology showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma invading through the muscularis puerperia .\\nOne of ten lymph nodes was positive for tumor .\\nShe was therefore staged Dukes C2 .\\nAn abdominal CT scan obtained prior to surgery showed only sigmoid thickening and two noticeable lymph nodes in the region of the sigmoid .\\nA chest x-ray was read as clear .\\nShe is not to have any tumor markers sent before surgery .\\nShe presented to the Hematology / Oncology Clinic on 6/5/96 for evaluation of possible adjuvant chemotherapy .\\nShe began adjuvant chemotherapy coupled with pelvic radiation .\\nShe was receiving daily radiation treatments under the care of Dr. Aacent Slentjae of the Linatpromehack Worth Hospital for Radiation Therapy .\\nShe began treatment on 6/20/96 .\\nShe subsequently had three days of IV bolus 5-FU chemotherapy on June 25th , 26th and 27th of 1996 , which she tolerated well .\\nHer course was then complicated by the onset of severe back pain at the beginning of June .\\nShe had unremarkable lumbosacral films , except for degenerative joint disease .\\nAn MRI was performed on 6/25/96 to rule out cord compression and showed no evidence of cord compression .\\nHowever , they were unable to rule out a soft tissue abnormality at L5 encroaching on a neural foramen .\\nShe presented to the Retelk County Medical Center Emergency Room on 7/8/96 with complaints of several days of lower abdominal pain , nausea , anorexia and low grade temperatures .\\nShe denied diarrhea or vomiting , but did have constipation .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n(1) Colon carcinoma with transverse colectomy in 1992.\\n(2) Coronary artery disease , status post myocardial infarction with TPA thrombolysis .\\nCardiac catheterization showed sequential LAD and she underwent angioplasty twice to the LAD with good results .\\nAn echocardiogram in June of 1994 showed an ejection fraction of 40-45% .\\nHer baseline electrocardiogram showed a left bundle branch block .\\n(3) Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus .\\n(4) Osteoporosis .\\n(5) Hypercholesterolemia .\\n(6) History of herpes zoster .\\n(7) Status post appendectomy .\\n(8) Status post total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to the Surgical Service under the care of Dr. Lenni Pain .\\nHer abdominal exam revealed a diffusely tender abdomen which was greater in the lower quadrant without guarding , but with early peritoneal signs .\\nA KUB performed on the night of admission showed no free air and no small bowel obstruction or ileus .\\nAn abdominal CT scan with oral contrast did not show any evidence for fluid collection or abscess .\\nHowever , there was diffuse thickening of the small bowel up to the terminal ileum , as well as some thickening of the rectum .\\nThis was not in a clear vascular distribution and there was no air evident in the wall of the small or large bowel .\\nThese findings were felt to be consistent with radiation enteritis .\\nShe was admitted and made NPO .\\nOn admission , her white count was 15,000 with an absolute neutrophil count of 1,000 .\\nShe was initially afebrile and hemodynamically stable .\\nHer ANC dropped to about 200 over the next 48 hours and she developed guaiac positive diarrhea .\\nShe was begun on IV antibiotics on admission of mezlocillin , gentamicin and metronidazole .\\nShe was also placed on neutropenic precautions .\\nShe continued to spike fevers and had episodes of peritoneal signs .\\nHowever , repeated abdominal x-rays and CT scans continued to show no signs of obstruction or perforation .\\nHowever , she did show persistent inflammation of her small bowel consistent with radiation enteritis .\\nBy 7/15/96 she was no longer neutropenic but continued to spike low grade fevers .\\nBy 7/18/96 she had become afebrile and antibiotics were discontinued .\\nShe was continued on bowel rest and four days prior to discharge she became entirely pain free in her abdomen and was started on TPN .\\nOf note , a PICC line was placed for facilitating the administration of TPN .\\nOf note , shortly after starting on her TPN her phosphate level dropped to 1.8 and TPN was temporarily held due to concerns she may be suffering from receding syndrome .\\nShe was supplemented with Neutra-Phos and her TPN was restarted 18 hours later .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nWe recommend that she continue to rest her bowel for another seven days .\\nDuring this time she will continue to receive TPN .\\nAfter that period of time she should slowly start p.o. intake again starting with clear liquids and in particular avoiding fats and lactose .\\nHer small bowel is likely to be intolerant to lactose for the near future .\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\\nInsulin sliding scale b.i.d. , lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q. day , Neutra-phos 500 mg p.o. q. day , metopromide 10 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. nausea , nitroglycerin 1/150 tablets one sublingually q. 5 minutes x three p.r.n. chest pain , nizatidine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Ativan 1 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. nausea , nafcillin dose 4 mg in 24 hours , and TPN .\\nMake sure her TPN at this point is 6% amino acids and 15% dextrose and 400 kilo calories of lipids , total volume is 1.6 liters and it is to be administered over 20 hours .\\nIn addition to the above , she has the following additives :\\n20 mm/liter of potassium phosphate , 30.8 mEq per liter of potassium chloride , 30 mEq per liter of sodium chloride , 8 mEq per liter of magnesium sulfate , 94 ng per liter of calcium , 10 ml per day of multivitamins , 10 mg of vitamin K every Monday , 1 ml per day of trace elements , and 22 units of Regular insulin .\\nTherefore , her total potassium is 60 mEq per liter , total sodium is 30 , and total phosphate is 20 .\\nMs. Rule is to follow-up with Dr. Chelkjescchalsere , who can be reached at 148-701-5440 .\\nDictated By :\\nSHASQUALENA R.

blood pressure 116/80 , temperature 97.1 degrees , oxygen saturation 93% on room air .\\nHead and neck examination was benign .\\nSkin examination was notable for a leg ulcer and cellulitis to be delineated below .\\nThere were no spider angiomata .\\nNeck was supple with no thyromegaly .\\nLungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally .\\nThe heart examination revealed that the patient had a sustained PMI which was located in the left mid clavicular line , S1 , near complete obliteration of the second heart sound by a two out of six high pitched murmur peaking at mid to late systole and heard across the precordium .\\nIt radiates to both carotids bilaterally .\\nThere was also a blowing holosystolic murmur heard at the patient 's apex to axilla .\\nThere was no S3 appreciated

.\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\n1) Mental status changes :\\nOn admission to the emergency room , the patient was somewhat argumentative and confused as well as uncooperative with procedures .\\nA neurologic work-up was undertaken which included a CT scan of the head which revealed no acute bleed and a lumbar puncture which revealed a glucose of 72 , protein 65 , white blood cell count 19 , red blood cell count 11,500 with no evidence of xanthrochromasia .\\nThe Neurology Service evaluated the patient who felt that her agitation was most likely due to infection , her multiple medications , or her metabolic condition .\\nThe patient 's mental status slowly began to recover , however on the morning of the first day of admission , August 16 , 1998 , the patient was found after having fallen .\\nA neurological examination was performed which revealed no abnormality and imaging included a head scan which revealed no bleed and a cervical spine series which revealed degenerative joint disease but no obvious fracture .\\nThe patient decided not to pursue further testing with a neck CT scan .\\nAt the time of discharge , the patient 's mental status is back to its baseline .\\n2) Right lower extremity cellulitis :\\nThe patient was evaluated by the Surgical Service who felt that the wound was clean with some erythema but without evidence of true cellulitis .\\nThe patient 's antibiotics

History of perforated gastric ulcer treated with hemigastrectomy 03/2004 .\\nOPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES :\\nRadiation therapy to the right clavicle 07/16/2004 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nOne of several PUOMC admissions for this 88-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer initially diagnosed in 1997 and treated with surgery , radiation , and hormonal treatment .\\nShe had actually completed her five years of Tomaxifin , but was continuing to be plagued by menopausal symptoms and finally in the summery of 2004 understanding the obvious potential risks , she began an estrogen patch .\\nNot long afterwards she began to develop some bone pains which progressed over the late summer and fall requiring escalation of opiates and restaging confirmed the presence of metastases throughout her spine and in the base of her skull , ribs , arms , etc ... but no visceral involvement .\\nShe ultimately was admitted to the hospital because of delirium and difficulty controlling the pain .\\nShe had no fevers , chills , headaches , or neck stiffness .\\nThere had been no focal neurologic changes .\\nUp until this admission she had been relatively independent and was very dismayed to discover the extensive relapse of her disease .\\nOn admission to the hospital her temperature was 99 , heart rate 99 , blood pressure 151/87 , O2 saturation on room air was 92% .\\nShe did look mildly dyspneic .\\nHer lungs were clear .\\nShe had good range of motion throughout except for severe local tenderness and swelling on the mid third of her right clavicle which impaired right shoulder movement .\\nShe was oriented to place and name and this waxed and waned over the next couple of days .\\nThe rest of her neurologic exam was essentially intact .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nSodium of 137 , BUN of 25 , creatinine of 0.9 , glucose of 77 , calcium slightly high at 10.9 with an albumin of 3.7 .\\nBilirubin normal .\\nHer ALT 11 , her AST slightly up at 59 .\\nHer alk phos slightly up at 174 .\\nWBC 10.8 with normal differential .\\nHemoglobin 12.2 , hematocrit 36.6 , MCV 89 , platelets 345,0000 .\\nA urinalysis showed cloudy urine with 10-20 red cells and 20-50 white cells .\\nA CA 153 was significantly elevated at 66.5 ( normal 0-30 ) .\\nThe patient was brought to the floor , hydrated gently , given another dose of Zomaten to help with her calcium and over the next few days remained relatively lethargic while we held some of her long acting opiates .\\nShe gradually began to improve and was able to tell if the worst pain was in the right clavicle .\\nThis was assessed promptly by an x-ray that confirmed pathologic fracture of that site .\\nShe also went on to have cervical , thoracic , and lumbosacral MRIs to confirm the wide spread bony metastases in the vertebral bodies and old degenerative changes perhaps with some indentation of the thecal sac but with no radiologic evidence for cord compression .\\nShe had had some urinary hesitancy and difficulty moving her legs in the first few days that had lead to the concern to _________ quinine syndrome but as soon as the opiates were tapered down she was able to void spontaneously and soon began to ambulate with the help of Physical Therapy .\\nA single fraction to the collar bone seemed to help with pain .\\nHer bowels required fairly heavy duty osmotic laxatives to keep them open .\\nThe sudden plunge in such a dependent state left her quite depressed and ultimately a small dose of Dexedrine was started partly to overcome the sedation of the opiates and perhaps improve her mood since more traditional antidepressants would take four to six weeks .\\nPLAN :\\nEscalate the doses of the Dexedrine perhaps up to a maximum of 10 mg at 8 o'clock in the morning and another 10 mg around noon and see if she can get reasonable sleep at night on this schedule , adding on Remeron at night time for sleep as an antidepressant would be a possibility or to go right to a conventional SSRI overlap until it seems to show more affect .\\nShe lives with her elderly husband and he was appropriately overwhelmed by the prospect of caring for her single-handedly , hence the transfer to a skilled nursing facility for a week or two of rehab .\\nThe patient and husband clearly expressed during this visit that she would not want cardiopulmonary resuscitation or intubation and ventilator support in the event of cardiopulmonary arrest .\\nShe was begun on Letrazole as an ____________ inhibitor for her breast cancer and discussions were begun to consider a possible course or two of Xeloda perhaps at a dose reduced scheduled if she continues to make progress in rehab and can return to Dr. First 's office to have further discussions of this later approach .\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\\nZofran 8 mg p.o. q.8 p.r.n. nausea .\\nDoculax 5 mg p.o. q.d. p.r.n.

Weekscook University Medical Center with a diagnosis of possible asthma .\\nRoom air arterial blood gas showed a pO2 of 56 , a pCO2 of 35 , and a pH of 7.52 .\\nEKG showed sinus tachycardia at 100 and echo revealed pericardial effusion , a 10 mm pulsus paradoxus was noted , and no evidence of tamponade .\\nGiven the patient 's history of cervical cancer , the pericardial effusion was felt most likely to be malignant .\\nShe was therefore transferred to the Retelk County Medical Center for further care .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nAs above .\\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY :\\n02/90 , total abdominal hysterectomy complicated by ureteral transection with right ureteral tube placed for six weeks , stent tube placed in left ureter six weeks prior to admission for a hydronephrosis post , in 03/91 , bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and appendectomy .\\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS :\\nPrednisone 20 mg p.o. q.a.m. with 10 mg p.o. q.p.m. , Uniphyl 400 mg p.o. q.d. , Augmentin 250 p.o. t.i.d. , Estrase 2 mg p.o. q.d. , MS Contin 30 mg q.12h. , and Morphine p.r.n.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nEmaciated white female in mild respiratory distress .\\nTemperature was 98.1 , heart rate 116 , blood pressure 120/68 , and room air O2 saturation was 93% .\\nHEENT :\\nDry mucous membranes and myotic pupils .\\nNECK :\\nNo lymphadenopathy .\\nCHEST :\\nFew inspiratory wheezes and no rhonchi .\\nHEART :\\nRegular rate and rhythm with tachycardia and no rubs or murmur .\\nABDOMEN :\\nWell healed Pfannenstiel scars and no masses .\\nPELVIC :\\nNo masses .\\nRECTAL :\\nNo masses and guaiac negative .\\nEXTREMITIES :\\nNo edema or cyanosis .\\nLABORATORY EXAMINATION :\\nHematocrit was 40 , white count was 21 , and platelet count of 723,000 .\\nPT and PTT were 12 and 26 .\\nElectrolytes were within normal limits , liver function tests within normal limits , and EKG showed a heart rate of 128 , axis 73 , and possible ectopic P .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted for a new pericardial effusion which was felt most likely to be secondary to metastatic cervical cancer .\\nThere was no evidence of tamponade .\\nAn echocardiogram was scheduled and Cardiology was consulted .\\nEchocardiogram showed moderate anterior pericardial effusion of approximately 600 cc with diastolic indications of the right ventricle and low velocity paradox .\\nCardiology did not feel that tamponade at this time was a concern and that a tap need not be performed .\\nShe continued to have pulmonary wheezing , unknown origin , without history of asthma .\\nHer steroids were tapered and Pulmonary was consulted who recommended a CT scan of the chest to evaluate the lung parenchyma , induce sputum for CBC , arterial blood gas , continuing of the beta agonist inhalers , and trial of steroid inhalers .\\nThey felt it was most likely a malignant lymphangitic spread with pericardial involvement versus infectious , other cardiovascular causes , or viral bronchiolitis .\\nShe had pulmonary function tests repeated which showed an FEV1 of 36% of predicted and FVC of 56% of predicted .\\nRoom air arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.45 , pO2 of 63 , a pCO2 of 41 , and fairly significant AA gradient .\\nShe was continued on two liters of oxygen awaiting her CT scan on 06/14 and she developed a new junctional rhythm with a question of a new rub versus murmur on examination .\\nCardiology felt she had a rub and her pulsus was still 10 .\\nEKG showed an ectopic low atrial P and they thought she was still stable without evidence of tamponade .\\nShe should have a follow-up echocardiogram .\\nEchocardiogram showed left ventricle at the upper limits of normal for size , low normal function , moderate to mild effusion with pericardial pressures exceeding right atrial pressures , and right ventricular pressures at various points of patient 's cycle without any change in the effusion from 06/11 .\\nThoracic Surgery was also consulted and they felt that there was no need for a pericardial window at the time .\\nShe should be continued with pulmonary oximetry testing .\\nShe underwent her CT scan .\\nThis showed lymphangitic spread of cancer in the chest , question of pulmonary nodules in the chest , pericardial effusion , multiple liver metastases , decreased function of the left kidney , dilated left intrarenal collecting system and proximal ureter , and periaortic lymphadenopathy .\\nPulmonary felt this was consistent also with lymphangitic spread and they did not feel that a bronchoscopy would be of any assistance at this time .\\nChemotherapy for metastatic cervical cancer was discussed with the patient and she was started on 5-FU 800 mg per meter squared days 06/18 , 06/19 , and 06/20 .\\nShe also received Cisplatin 35 per meter squared on 06/19 and Ifex and Mesna on 06/18 .\\nShe was noted , on 06/16 , to have numerous erythematous maculopapules on her back and chest .\\nDermatology was consulted and they felt that this was most likely steroid acne .\\nThey therefore felt a rapid steroid taper was indicated and topical Erythromycin if desired by the patient .\\nThe patient 's shortness of breath and wheezing continued but without change .\\nHer cardiac examination remained the same and there continued to be no evidence of tamponade .\\nCardiology felt that follow-up echo was indicated on 06/18 as she had another echocardiogram which showed no change or evidence of tamponade .\\nThey therefore felt that she could be continued to be followed by examination .\\nShe had some mental status changes with confusion and hallucinations on 06/18 originating from narcotics versus decreased pO2 .\\nThe Ifex was held as it was felt that it could have precipitated the mental status changes and that she was to receive no further Ifex .\\nShe had no further hallucinations since stopping the Ifex .\\nPsychiatry was also consulted to help her with the changes she was feeling since her new diagnosis .\\nShe was hooked up with support services in Collot Ln , Dugo , Indiana 68961 for further counselling and given Xanax for symptoms of anxiety .\\nShe continued to have no change in her shortness of breath or cardiac examination and was discharged home on 06/22/91 after completing her 5-FU and Cisplatin chemotherapy .\\nDISPOSITION :\\nShe will be followed by Dr. Mielke and home care services .\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\\nPremarin 0.625 q.d. , Proventil Inhaler two puffs q.i.d. , Beclovent four puffs b.i.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. , MS Contin 30 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Elavil 25 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Trilisate

Respiratory failure .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient was a 53-year-old male with a longstanding history of renal disease with multiple complications and problems related to vascular access and hypercoagulable state .\\nThese culminated in an attempted cadaveric kidney transplant undertaken on 12/16/97 , which was complicated by thrombosis and necrosis of the cadaveric renal vein within 24 hours .\\nThis required a transplant nephrectomy .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\\nThe patient 's course was subsequently characterized by recurrent pneumonias , possibly due to aspiration , and by hemodynamic instability .\\nHe was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit from the Transplant Service for ventilatory management in the setting of hypotension .\\nOn transfer , the patient was not sedated , but was unresponsive and extremely dyssynchronous with the ventilator .\\nThe patient was found to have substantial auto PEEP with an elevated dead space .\\nA pulmonary arteriogram on 01/03/98 demonstrated multiple pulmonary emboli , likely less than one week old , possibly introduced at the time of the renal vein thrombosis of 12/19/97 .\\nAn inferior vena cava filter was placed ; lower extremity noninvasive studies were negative .\\nThe patient required high pressures to ventilate adequately , possibly related to an abdominal compartment syndrome .\\nThe patient had undergone two abdominal procedures following explantation .\\nThe physiology at the time of transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit was consistent with a septic process .\\nCT scan demonstrated retroperitoneal collection containing both free air and extravasated contrast material .\\nFor the concern of a perforated viscus , the patient was taken to exploratory laparotomy on 01/06/98 , during which the bowel was run without evidence of perforation .\\nThe patient remained unstable .\\nHe was taken to fluoroscopy , where oral contrast was demonstrated to be extravasating through a posterior duodenum .\\nFor this reason , he was taken again to the operating room on 01/08/98 , at which time a gastrojejunostomy was performed with stapling across the gastroduodenal junction , introduction of five Jackson-Pratt drains into the retroperitoneal mass , cholecystotomy tube , gastrostomy tube , and jejunostomy tube .\\nThe patient had an extensive estimated blood loss requiring multiple blood products and fluid resuscitation therapy .\\nAccompanying this during this period were elevations in liver function studies and amylase and lipase consistent with pancreatic inflammation .\\nThe patient was aggressively treated with fluid resuscitation and pressors for his septic physiology .\\nThere was no evidence of cardiac tamponade or specific underlying coronary dysfunction .\\nHe was treated with appropriate antibiotics for his Serratia pneumonia , as well as for his abdominal process .\\nThe patient was felt to have an underlying hypercoagulable state , thought to be the source for the repeated clots .\\nBecause of the bleeding problems , however , it was felt that full heparinization would not be prudent , and the patient was treated with pneumo-boots and subcutaneous heparin .\\nAttention was paid to a variety of metabolic and electrolyte abnormalities , which were corrected appropriately .\\nNonetheless , Mr. Less continued to remain critically ill with only very transient mild improvement with drainage of additional retroperitoneal fluid .\\nHe remained pressor dependent , as well as dependent upon mechanical ventilatory assistance .\\nHis course was complicated by atrial fibrillation requiring cardioversion .\\nHe had an ongoing requirement for high volume resuscitation and was persistently acidotic despite CV-VVH in the face of bicarbonate replenishment .\\nThe patient also appeared to have stool from his Jackson-Pratt site and right oblique incision .\\nBloody drainage from his increasingly distended abdomen was noted .\\nExtensive discussions were carried out with Mrs. Less condition was irretrievable .\\nIt was felt that the patient had continued massive retroperitoneal contamination and probable multiple enteric fistulae from an ischemic bowel .\\nDr. Cantsleddjesc felt that no surgical approach to this problem or further intervention or radiologic procedures would be helpful .\\nAll physicians and the family were in agreement that the most appropriate approach was to institute comfort measures .\\nThis was done , and the patient appeared to be comfortable at the time of death with his family at his side on 1/16/98 .\\nI L.

then , Dr. Thorebreutz took him to the operating room , where he had quadruple coronary artery bypass grafting .\\nHe had a left internal mammary artery graft of the LAD , a single saphenous vein to the right coronary artery with 280 cc per minute flow , and a saphenous vein snake graft to the diagonal and circumflex with 150 cc per minute flow .\\nA paraphimosis was noted and treated by Dr. Ryna Jescdrig .\\nAfter surgery he had a ongoing sinus tachycardia .\\nHe was able to be rapidly weaned and extubated .\\nHe had good hemodynamics .\\nHe had occasional atrial and ventricular premature beats .\\nHis intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned the following day and he was transferred out of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .\\nHe was seen in consultation by the Nutrition Service , who followed him for dietary management of his diabetes mellitus .\\nOn 08/05 it was noted that his platelet count had fallen from 171,000 to 54,000 ; this was thought to be associated with intravenous Heparin and indeed , when Heparin was discontinued , since it had been restarted after surgery , his platelet count rebounded to normal .\\nTherefore , he does have a thrombocytopenic reaction to Heparin .\\nHe remained in normal sinus rhythm .\\nHe did have runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia , which were clinically stable .\\nHe had a right bundle branch block .\\nHe is at increased risk for future events because of his low left ventricular ejection fraction , but he is clinically stable on ACE inhibitors , Digoxin , Coumadin , and aspirin .\\nTherefore he was able to be discharged home .\\nHe understands that he does have significant left ventricle dysfunction and requires monitoring of his prothrombin times and his arrhythmias ; these will be done in Grovea Co Terburgperv Portnew .\\nACHASTHA N.

:\\n083-97-79\\nADMISSION DATE :\\n09/15/1998\\nDISCHARGE DATE :\\n09/23/98\\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\\nWolfe-Parkinson White Syndrome .\\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\\nAtrial fibrillation , coronary artery disease , hypertension , dementia , and diabetes .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient is a 72 year old white male who was transferred from Cay Memorial Hospital Of for cardiac catheterization and Electrophysiology Studies .\\nHis cardiac risk factors include :\\nhypercholesterolemia , hypertension and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus .\\nHe has a history of chest pain and in January 1993 underwent a cardiac catheterization at Ph University Of Medical Center which revealed an occluded right coronary artery with distal filling via left to right collaterals , a large left anterior descending with a 40-50% proximal stenosis and a co-dominant left circumflex with mild disease .\\nHe subsequently had an echocardiogram in December 1994 which showed normal left ventricular size and systolic function .\\nHe subsequently had an adenosine sestamibi in February 1997 which was negative for ischemia or infarction .\\nIn December 1994 he had a paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia presenting with palpitations .\\nHe was diagnosed with Wolfe Parkinson White Syndrome .\\nHe underwent an electrophysiology study which identified an accessory pathway with multiple attempts at ablation by Dr. Slusslashgodle which were unsuccessful .\\nHe was treated with Sotalol for the supraventricular tachycardia .\\nOn 9/2/98 he was admitted to Cay Memorial Hospital Of with palpitations and was found to have an irregular wide complex tachycardia thought to be due to atrial fibrillation and conduction down his accessory pathway .\\nHe had mild congestive heart failure and was treated with an increased dose of Lasix .\\nAn echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of approximately 50% and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation .\\nHe was discharged home but returned on 9/13/98 with worsening palpitations on and off .\\nHe was again found to be in a wide complex tachycardia and was treated with magnesium .\\nHe denied any associated chest pain or dyspnea and he ruled out for a myocardial infarction .\\nHe continued to have intermittent runs of the wide complex tachycardia and was therefore transferred to Ph University Of Medical Center for further evaluation and management .\\nPrior to transfer he did have one episode of chest pain during the night without electrocardiogram changes .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nHypertension , hypercholesterolemia , diabetes mellitus , depression , prostate cancer status post surgery .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nSotalol 160 mg bid .\\nAtenolol 25 mg bid .\\nPrilosec 20 mg qd .\\nPropulsid 10 mg qd .\\nNPH and CZI insulin .\\nResulin 400 mg qd .\\nLisinopril 10 mg bid .\\nAspirin .\\nLasix 60 mg qd .\\nALLERGIES :\\nHe reports an allergy to both codeine and iodine .\\nThere was also a question of an allergy to Prednisone which he said causes eye swelling .\\nHowever , the details of this are quite uncertain and it is not clear if this was a true allergy .\\nPHYSICAL EXAM :\\nHe was comfortable with a blood pressure of 156/78 , pulse 56 and respirations of 16 .\\nHis lungs were clear throughout .\\nHis apical impulse was nondisplaced with a regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 but not S3 or S4 .\\nThere was a grade 1/6 holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border radiating to the apex .\\nCarotid pulses were 2+ bilaterally and there was no jugular venous distention .\\nHis abdomen was benign .\\nFemoral pulses were 2+ bilaterally without bruits and he had pedal edema bilaterally .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nBUN 18 , creatinine 1.8 , magnesium 1.5 , cholesterol 154 with an HDL 41 , LDL 100 .\\nHis creatinine phosphokinase was 42 .\\nHis hematocrit was 49.3 .\\nHis electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia with a delta wave and an intraventricular conduction delay consistent with Wolf Parkinson White Syndrome .\\nThere were also nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\\nThe patient clearly was suffering from atrial arrhythmias conducting down his bypass tract which were difficult to manage and causing symptomatic palpitations .\\nGiven his known coronary artery disease and his recent heart failure and chest pain a cardiac catheterization was indicated prior to proceeding to an electrophysiology study .\\nHis initial cardiac catheterization had to be postponed given the possibility of an allergy to Prednisone .\\nHe was seen by Nnoatal Hospital Center who felt that he could be safely treated with Solumedrol rather than Prednisone together with Benadryl and the use of low ionic contrast medium .\\nAccordingly the patient underwent uneventful cardiac catheterization on 9/17/98 which revealed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 25 and a left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 20 .\\nHis right coronary artery was occluded and filled distally via left to right collaterals .\\nHe had a 50% proximal left anterior descending stenosis and only minor disease to the left circumflex .\\nHis left ventriculogram showed preserved systolic function and mild mitral regurgitation .\\nThe patient then underwent an electrophysiology study on 9/20/98 .\\nThere was no inducible supraventricular tachycardia but he did have evidence of a left lateral bypass tract .\\nMapping of the mitral anulus confirmed the location of the bypass tract .\\nRadiofrequency ablation was applied there and resulted in the elimination of the preoperatively-excitation .\\nThere were no complications .\\nFollowing the procedure there was no further evidence of wide complex tachycardia .\\nHe still did have occasional short runs of atrial tachycardia but there were no associated palpitations .\\nIn following up his ablation he underwent a Holter monitor which showed normal sinus rhythm at rates of 40 to 80 .\\nThere were 15 atrial runs the longest of which was 13 beats at a rate of 100 .\\nHe also underwent a post-procedural echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 61% with mild mitral regurgitation and left atrial enlargement at 45mm .\\nFollowing the procedure his QT interval was noted to be prolonged to approximately .55 seconds .\\nHis Sotalol was therefore decreased to 120 mg bid and his QT and QTC intervals decreased to .45-.48 seconds .\\nAfter the procedure he was started on Heparin and loaded on Coumadin for a period of the next 3-4 weeks following radiofrequency ablation .\\nHis INR was 2.3 prior to discharge and he was scheduled to follow-up with the Anticoagulation Clinic to follow his Coumadin dose .\\nFinally , his dementia appeared to worsen following receiving medications for agitation during his EP study .\\nAccordingly he was seen by Neurology who felt that there was no evidence of a secondary process .\\nHe did have a head CT which showed no evidence of a bleed or stroke .\\nFinally , his blood pressure had trended up during his hospitalization particularly with the decreased dose of Sotalol .\\nGiven his occasional sinus bradycardia his Atenolol was not advanced but instead his Zestril dose was increased from 10-20 mg bid and his blood pressure responded appropriately .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nHe was discharged in stable condition on 9/23/98 .\\nHe will have a visiting nurse to see him on Iat .\\nFOLLOW-UP :\\nHe will follow-up with Dr. Taarnna Service at Ph University Of Medical Center as well as Dr. Lupevickette Folk and Dr. Dwainco Rallsversgach on Villean Garl .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nAtenolol 25 mg bid .\\nSotalol 120 mg bid .\\nLasix 60 mg qd .\\nEcotrin 1 qd ( on hold until off of Coumadin ) .\\nCoumadin 5 mg qhs or as directed for four weeks .\\nPrilosec 20 mg qd .\\nPropulsid 10 mg qd .\\nOxybutynin 5 mg qd .\\nAricept 10 mg qhs .\\nNPH insulin 8 units q am , 5 units q pm

infection on maximal antimicrobial therapy continued , with emergence on November 20 of a new right-sided ptosis in association with a left homonymous hemianopsia , and fleeting confusion while febrile , prompting head MRI which revealed a large 5 x 2 x 4.3 cm region in the right occipital lobe of hemorrhage and edema , with dural and , likely , leptomeningeal enhancement in association with small foci in the right cerebellum and pons , concerning for early lesions of similar type .\\nIdiosyncratic reaction to cyclosporine was considered as cause for cerebritis , and cyclosporine was discontinued .\\nHowever , much more likely explanation is progressive infection of Acanthamoeba with new neurologic involvement .\\nMost likely source of fevers was judged to be progressive Acanthamoeba infection , even on maximal antimicrobial therapy .\\nA single blood culture positive for coagulase negative Staphylococcus was treated with a course of vancomycin in the setting of a PICC line and a chest x-ray on November 20 indicating possible developing pneumonia , resulted in a course of levofloxacin , for both possible pneumonia , as well as treatment of any bacterial superinfection of Acanthamoeba sinusitis .\\nPatient experienced steady decline , with persistent fevers despite all above measures , progressive areas of skin infection , more frequent episodes of confusion , and decreasing oxygen saturation in the setting of bilateral effusion , in the setting of fluid surge spacing .\\nOn November 30 , a family meeting with patient \\'s daughter and spouse , along with primary oncologist , Dr. Tomedankell Bile , attending physician , Dr. Mellerny Close , and house staff , was held to discuss patient \\'s critical condition and inability to prevent progression of skin , sinus and neurological Acanthamoeba infection on maximal antimicrobial therapy .\\nDecision was made to withdraw aggressive measures of care , with priority on patient \\'s comfort .\\nPentamidine , itraconazole , Levaquin , acyclovir and GCSF were discontinued , along with other medications nonessential to patient \\'s comfort .\\nDNR / DNI status initially established early during hospital stay remained in effect .\\nThe patient was made comfortable with morphine for pain and for air hunger , and sinus suctioning was continued to relieve congestion , in conjunction with continuation of nasal sprays .\\nTylenol was continued to control fevers and prednisone was continued to control inflammation and prevent precipitation of adrenal insufficiency .\\nSuch measures

:\\n2/17/94 :\\nresection and grafting of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm .\\nHISTORY :\\nThe patient is a 74 year old female who was involved in a motor vehicle accident on 11/18/93 at which time her workup revealed a large thoracoabdominal aneurysm at the Eifro Medical Center which was evaluated with a chest X-ray and abdominal CT scan .\\nAt that time the patient denied any symptoms of aneurysmal pain and did not suffer significant injury from her motor vehicle accident .\\nShe was subsequently referred to Dr. Riode Zetllille for evaluation and workup of her aneurysm .\\nThe patient underwent a thoracic abdominal arteriogram on 12/31/93 via a right femoral approach and she was noted to have a large descending aorta with tortuosity but no aneurysmal dilatation of the infrarenal abdominal aorta .\\nThe patient was discharged after the procedure was performed and subsequently admitted in this hospitalization for elective resection .\\nSince the patient 's last admission she gives no history of chest or back pain and continues to be quite active .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination she is a well developed female in no distress .\\nHer head and neck examination is within normal limits .\\nHer lungs were clear to auscultation .\\nHer lung and pericardic examination is regular rate and rhythm .\\nHer abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .\\nShe has a pulsatile upper abdominal mass .\\nExtremities :\\nare well perfused and she has a small left inguinal hernia .\\nShe has a well healed right groin scar and pulse examination reveals 2 plus pulses from the carotids through the posterior tibial arteries bilaterally .\\nNeurologically she is awake and alert , she has normal cranial nerve function and her motor examination is within normal limits .\\nLABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION :\\nIs remarkable for normal serum electrolytes with creatinine 1.2 , hematocrit 31.9 and normal coagulation studies .\\nEKG reveals a normal sinus rhythm , normal intervals with slight left ventricular hypertrophy repolarization abnormality .\\nHer chest X-ray is remarkable only for a tortuous aorta on the anterior projection .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted and underwent resection and grafting of a thoracoabdominal aneurysm which she tolerated well .\\nThere were no intraoperative complications .\\nShe was taken to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively .\\nThe patient 's procedure was also remarkable for the fact that she underwent spinal cooling during this procedure .\\nThe patient remained intubated postoperatively .\\nShe had a stable first postoperative day without evidence of hemodynamic or cardiopulmonary deterioration .\\nOn postoperative day 1 she had a slight hematocrit drop to 27.2 which was expected with hydration in addition to intraoperative volume loss but otherwise had an unremarkable course .\\nEpidural anesthesia was used throughout her course for pain management and she was transferred to the Surgical floor on postoperative day two .\\nThe patient developed an episode of atrial fibrillation with physical examination consistent with only mild cardiopulmonary congestion as manifested by bilateral scattered rales in the lung fields .\\nSerum electrolytes at the time revealed normal potassium levels and the patient was treated with p.r.n. verapamil and digoxin therapy for a heart rate varying between 80 and 110 .\\nThe patient 's oxygen saturations continued to maintain at levels greater than 95 percent and this was felt to be well controlled and she was placed on digoxin chronically and also diuresed for therapy .\\nShe was transferred to the Surgical floor where on postoperative day three she began to complain of hypersensitivity in the left lower extremity and inability to move her toes .\\nThis was a new finding considering postoperatively she had full motor and sensory function of all four extremities .\\nNeurologic assessment at the time did in fact reveal profound paresis of the left lower extremity only with absent reflexes but hyperesthesia to light touch throughout the lower extremities .\\nLaboratory data obtained revealed no significant changes from her initial postoperative levels .\\nNeurological consultation was obtained .\\nIt was felt that the patient had been subjected significant cord ischemia and possibly this neurologic event also related to spinal or epidural catheter placement .\\nThe epidural catheter had been removed prior to their evaluation and no return of significant function was noted over the ensuing two days aside from flexion and extension of the toes but still the patient maintained profound proximal lower extremity weakness .\\nMRI obtained did not reveal evidence of a structural cause for cord or root dysfunction and further recommendation of abdominal CT scanning in addition to EMGs and SSEPs to further evaluate and confirm the site of the lesion be performed .\\nThe patient continued to do well otherwise being slowly progressed in her diet and mobilized from bed to chair without difficulty .\\nShe was placed on a bowel regimen to alleviate signs and symptoms of constipation while the workup to determine the exact etiology of her left lower extremity paresis could be identified .\\nContinued supportive care was performed for the patient as again she manifested no other significant signs of hemodynamic or neurologic deterioration .\\nHer ultimate diagnosis was subsequently felt to be a segmental infarction of the anterior and lateral part of her T10 level spinal cord and there was no evidence of that recovery of her left lower extremity would be obtained .\\nSocial Service consultation for rehabilitation placement was performed .\\nThe patient understands the ramifications of her disability and continued neurologic assessment is to be made .\\nThe patient continued to make slight gains in motor movement of the left lower extremity as manifested by digital function and some knee jerk return and by postoperative day eight she was manifesting some dorsiflexion in addition to urodynamics being performed revealed good detrusion contraction , normal sensation and a coordinated sphincter which suggested no disability to the sympathetic control of her bowel and bladder .\\nThe patient complained of some urinary incontinence and urgency on the 10th postoperative day .\\nShe was placed on Bactrim therapy for E. coli positive urine culture and EMG performed revealed a lesion proximal in the central nervous system ( CNS ) consistent with central lesions .\\nAdditional neurological follow-up will be maintained as the patient continues to rehabilitate in the On Modenyheatl Rowbrook Of Medical Center .\\nIt is at this point encouraging that she continues to slowly regain some motor function of the left lower extremity but the patient has been advised that this may in fact not return .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nIs satisfactory .\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :\\n(1) status post thoracoabdominal aneurysm grafting and resection .\\nCOMPLICATIONS :\\nDuring this hospitalization include left lower extremity paresis as well as E. coli urinary tract infection .\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\\nLopressor 25 mg PO b.i.d. , Dulcolax tablets 2 PO q.a.m. , Dulcolax suppository 1 PO q.o.d. , digoxin .125 mg PO q. day , Bactrim DS b.i.d. ,

ILLNESS :\\nREASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :\\nShalyo Kaysplass is a 36-year-old male , with metastatic malignant fibrous histiocytoma of bone , admitted with shortness of breath , hemoptysis , and hip pain .\\nMr. Kaysplass 's history is well-documented in previous discharge summaries .\\nBasically , he was diagnosed in 1994 with malignant fibrous histiocytoma of bone in his left hip , underwent multiple cycles of chemotherapy , but was not a candidate for surgical resection and so underwent radiation therapy to the left hip .\\nHe had metastases to the lungs , which responded to more chemotherapy and he underwent autologous bone marrow transplantation in January , 1996 .\\nFor the past six weeks prior to admission , the patient was complaining of worsening right hip pain at the site of a bone marrow biopsy done to evaluate a new pancytopenia .\\nAn magnetic resonance imaging scan showed a mass growing out of the right sacrum , which could have been tumor or a hematoma .\\nApproximately a week before admission , repeat magnetic resonance imaging scan showed an enlarging soft tissue mass consistent with tumor .\\nChest x-ray showed multiple pulmonary nodules , which were thought , given the clinical situation , to be tumor .\\nThe patient was set to undergo radiation therapy to the mass in the right hip when he called complaining of fatigue , dyspnea on exertion , and persistent hip pain .\\nHe also complained of fever .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nShalyo Kaysplass is an obese man in mild respiratory distress .\\nHis oxygen saturation was 85% on room air .\\nHis chest had diffuse rales .\\nHeart :\\nregular rate and rhythm , although rapid .\\nAbdomen :\\nsoft , nontender , nondistended .\\nExtremities :\\nno clubbing , cyanosis , or edema .\\nNeurological exam was nonfocal .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\\nThe patient responded to oxygen , however , his pain in his hip was severe and required Morphine drip .\\nHis hemoptysis did not improve and his platelet count was quite low .\\nDue to intermittent bouts of shortness of breath , and the understanding that he had a widely-metastatic malignant fibrous histiocytoma of bone , he was made a do not resuscitate , and on the fifth hospital day , the patient expired .\\nCA SHUFF , M.D.\\nDICTATING FOR :\\n_________________________ LENNI BREUTZOLN , M.D.\\nTR :\\njei\\nDD

:\\nThe patient is a 40-year-old , right-handed , white male with a Grade III glioma of the cerebellum originally diagnosed in 07/96 .\\nHe was treated at that time with subtotal resection followed by radiation to the lesion .\\nHe had been maintained on low-dose steroid for most of the last 1 years because of increasing symptoms when the medication was tapered .\\nHe was referred to Neuro Oncology Clinic on 11/28/96 with complaints of choking on liquids , increasing facial weakness and imbalance .\\nHe also had reported progressive fatigue and weakness with an inability to arise from a sitting position without the use of his hands .\\nHe had recently had a fall and had to crawl back to his vehicle because of an inability to right himself .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn examination in the office he was obviously cushingoid with a protuberant abdomen and cachectic arms and legs .\\nHis neck was supple with no spinal tenderness .\\nThere was a complete left seventh nerve palsy .\\nThere was horizontal nystagmus on right and left gaze and some beats of vertical nystagmus when looking up or down .\\nThere was 4/5 neck flexor , bilateral deltoid and iliopsoas weakness with wasting of the quadriceps musculature .\\nHis distal strength was relatively preserved .\\nSensation to touch was preserved .\\nThere was normal appendicular coordination but obvious truncal ataxia with a widening of his base and an inability to tandem .\\nOn general examination it was also noted that he had oral thrush as well as multiple subcutaneous firm but mobile nodules .\\nAn MRI from 11/96 compared to his most recent MRI demonstrated residual enhancing mass near the roof of the left fourth ventricle as well as obvious ependymal enhancement in the frontal horns , body and occipital horns of the lateral ventricles .\\nThe patient was admitted with a diagnosis of recurrent malignant glioma with ependymal spread .\\nThere was also great concern that he had developed cranial neuropathy and was choking and aspirating .\\nThere was also obvious steroid toxicity .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\\nThe patient was evaluated by the Speech Pathology Service who identified a mild dysarthria and oral dysphagia .\\nIt was not felt that he was significantly aspirating and a modified barium swallow was not necessary .\\nHe underwent a lumbar puncture on 11/29/96 which was traumatic , showing 58,000 red blood cells and increased protein .\\nAn ample specimen was sent for cytological analysis .\\nHe also was treated with Nystatin and Mycelex for his oral thrush and his Dexamethasone was changed to Prednisone in an effort to improve the weakness due to his steroid myopathy .\\nHe was also given Lacri-Lube for the left eye as it was not fully closing due to his facial palsy .\\nThe patient was discharged on 11/30/96 back to his home in Sastonton-mont , Ohio .\\nHe will be enrolled in an experimental chemotherapy protocol for recurrent malignant glioma .\\nThe case will be discussed at Brain Tumor Conference on 12/03/96 .\\nHe will also start a physical therapy program for the steroid myopathy once he is back in Sler .\\nLAINESIBEY J.

creatinine .\\nBUN was 34 and creatinine was 2.6 , up from his baseline of 1.0 .\\nProstate specific antigen increased from 77.9 to 88 , and the patient also had urinary incontinence and body weight loss .\\nFurther evaluation of his renal failure showed that the patient has bilateral hydronephrosis , most likely obstructive uropathy due to prostate CA in the pelvic area .\\nBecause of the increasing creatinine to 8.0 on February 28 , 1999 , a left nephrostomy tube was placed .\\nHowever after the procedure , the patient 's hematocrit dropped to 24 and he was transfused two units of packed red blood cells .\\nHis hematocrit increased to about 30 , but he continued to have hematuria and his renal function only improved very slowly .\\nHe also received Kayexalate for hyperkalemia .\\nDue to the persistent blood in the urine , he was transferred from Eifro Medical Center to the Retelk County Medical Center for angiographic studies to rule out any vascular injuries .\\nThe patient was transferred to Genearocktemp Ry Health on March 3 , 1999 .\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS :\\nThe patient had constipation with dysuria , but no fever or chills .\\nNo cough .\\nNo chest pain .\\nNo palpitations , history of epigastric pain and body weight loss .\\nNo headache .\\nNo bone pain .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1) Hypertension .\\n2) Gastroesophageal reflux disease .\\n3) Anemia .\\n4)

has been living in the Kansas for more than 20 years .\\nHe was originally from Wark and he speaks Portuguese only .\\nHe is now living with his son and daughter , and five other children .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn admission , the patient was a frail looking elderly male lying in bed in no acute distress .\\nTemperature 95.4 , pulse 120 , blood pressure 150/80 , respiratory rate 24 , 95% on room air .\\nConjunctiva were not pale .\\nSclera nonicteric .\\nPupils :\\nIsocoric cataract bilaterally .\\nMouth :\\nMucous membranes slightly dry .\\nNo oral ulcers .\\nNeck :\\nSupple .\\nJugular vein not engorged .\\nCarotid pulses bounding very strongly .\\nNo thyromegaly .\\nChest examination showed some basilar crackles at the right lung base .\\nHeart initially tachycardia , grade II / VI systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border .\\nAbdomen :\\nSoft .\\nLiver and spleen were not palpable .\\nBowel sounds normoactive .\\nExtremities :\\nTraced pitting edema .\\nNo cyanosis and no clubbing .\\nPeripheral pulses were very strong and bounding .\\nNo calf tenderness .\\nHoman 's sign negative .\\nNeurologic :\\nExamination was limited because the patient speaks only Portuguese .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nOn admission the patient 's biochemistry showed sodium of 140 , potassium 4.0 , chloride 107 , bicarb 14 , BUN 63 , creatinine 5.8 , blood sugar 133 .\\nLiver function test showed AST 21 , alkaline phosphatase 70 , total bilirubin 0.3 , total protein 6.5 , albumin 3.9 , globulin 2.6 .\\nCBC :\\nWBC 8.4 , hematocrit 32.6 , platelet count 194,000 .\\nPT 11.9 , INR 1.0 , PTT 28.4 .\\nChest x-ray showed no evidence of cardiomegaly .\\nNo lung infiltrate .\\nCT scan of the renal area showed right hydronephrosis which extends to an asymmetrically thickened urinary bladder wall .\\nA mass like thickening of the urinary bladder suggestive of either detrusor hypertrophy or possibly tumor .\\nThe CT scan showed a cavitary lung lesion in the right lower lobe compatible with metastatic or septic embolus .\\nEKG showed atrial fibrillation , left axis deviation , LVH , nonspecific ST-T changes either due to digitalis affect .\\nCK enzymes 146 .\\nRepeated three times and remained flat .\\nTroponin I on the second day of admission was 1.18 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nAfter admission , urology , nephrology as well as interventional radiology was consulted about the management of this patient .\\nThe specialist concluded that because the patient 's hematuria seemed to be stable and hematocrit to maintain at about 29-30 , there is no urgent need to do an arteriogram which may cause further damage to the patient 's kidney .\\nUrology consultation thinks that cystoscopy would not add any benefit to the management and only would consider a right nephrostomy if renal function failed to improve .\\nAfter admission , the patient was treated conservatively to correct his electrolyte and metabolic acidosis .\\nHe was given blood transfusion , two units when his hematocrit dropped to 29.4 .\\nAfter transfusion , the patient 's hematocrit rose to 37.7 on the day of discharge .\\nThe patient was also given sodium bicarbonate to correct his metabolic acidosis .\\nHe continued to pass about 1500-2000 cc of urine a day and his renal function improved slowly with creatinine decreased to 4.2 on the day of discharge .\\nDuring this admission , the patient also developed atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate of about 70-80 .\\nCPK was tracked , but was totally normal .\\nNo beta blockers were given .\\nA long discussion amongst the specialist , nephrology , urology , interventional radiology , primary oncology as well with the family lead to the conclusion that conservative management may give the patient more comfort than crisis treatment in this well advanced prostate CA .\\nDr. Lucreamull discussed the patient 's clinical status and overall situation with the patient 's family and the family decided that Mr. Prehekote could return home with hospice .\\nThe patient 's primary care physician , Dr. Tomedankell Flowayles will manage the hospice issues .\\nThe patient was discharged to home for hospice on March 8 , 1999 .\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\\nBethanechol 25 milligrams p.o. t.i.d. , Clonidine 2.5 milligrams topical q. week , apply every Sunday , Colace 100 milligrams p.o. b.i.d. , Haldol 0.5-1

suprapubic catheter .\\nAnxiety .\\nCoronary artery disease .\\nHistory of colon cancer status post hemicolectomy .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis is a 76 year old white male with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who has had several recent admissions to Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital for respiratory insuffiencey most often secondary to pneumonia .\\nHe was most recently discharged from Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital on 03/06/99 and was then transferred to Linghs County Medical Center from which he was discharged on 03/20/99 .\\nThe patient was doing relatively at home until one day prior to admission he complained discomfort over a suprapubic catheter area .\\nThe patient had missed his usual monthly change of his suprapubic catheter and felt discomfort and noticed some blood at the site of the catheter .\\nThe patient was brought to the Emergency Room one day prior to admission where he was evaluated by Urology and had his catheter changed .\\nThe patient at that time noted slight shortness of breath but was sent home anyway .\\nOn the day of admission the patient noticed increasing shortness of breath .\\nThe patient was noted to be confused and to be disoriented toward the end of the day after complaining of shortness of breath for most of the day .\\nThe patient denies any recent upper respiratory infections , no fevers , no chills , no change in cough , sputum .\\nHe also denies any chest pain .\\nNo orthopnea .\\nNo paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea .\\nThe patient had been taking his usual medications and using his nasal oxygen at home .\\nBy the time the patient arrived at the Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital Emergency Room he was in moderate respiratory distress .\\nHis initial blood gases on 40% 02 was P02 102 , PC02 115 , PH 7.11 .\\nThe patient was given respiratory therapy in the way of nebulizer treatments in the Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital Emergency Room because of a longstanding desire by patient and family to refrain from intubation to be considered Do Not Resuscitate .\\nThe patient was not intubated .\\nHowever he was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where he received continuous respiratory therapy in theway of Albuterol nebulizers as well as nasal oxygen , intravenous steroids and intravenous antibiotics .\\nA chest x-ray in the Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital Emergency Room showed new changes on his chest x-ray on top of his usual severe bilateral emphysema_____ with scarring in both lungs .\\nThere were new air space opacifications in the left apex and the right lower lobe .\\nThese were thought to be consistent either with pneumonia or asymmetric pulmonary edema .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nAssociated medical problems include :\\n1. Atonic bladder with a suprapubic tube .\\n2. Anxiety .\\n3. Coronary artery disease with a history of angina in the distant past .\\n4. History of colon cancer with a colectomy in the past .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\n1. Ativan 1 mg po twice a day .\\n2. Trusopt 1 gtt left eye three times a day .\\n3. Xalatan 0.005% one gtt left eye qhs .\\n4. Brimonidine 1 gtt left eye three times a day .\\n5. Combivent 3 puffs four times per day .\\n6. Aerobid three puffs twice a day .\\n7. Sorbitol 30 cc every other day .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nHe was an elderly frail gentleman in moderate respiratory distress .\\nHe had a blood pressure 110/70 , heart rate 110 beats per minute and regular , respiratory rate 25 .\\nHe was in moderate respiratory distress .\\nHis temperature was 98F .\\nHe had a normal head , eyes , ears , nose and throat exam .\\nNeck exam revealed no jugular venous distention and no masses .\\nLung exam revealed decreased breath sounds as well as crackles in the bases .\\nThere were no wheezes or rhonchi .\\nHeart exam revealed a soft S1 and S2 , no murmur was heard , no S3 .\\nAbdomen was soft , nontender with no masses palpable .\\nRectal exam was unremarkable with stool heme negative .\\nNeurological exam revealed an alert and oriented x 3 elderly male .\\nHe moved all extremities .\\nDeep tendon reflexes were symmetrical in all extremities .\\nLABORATORY AND RADIOLOGIC DATA :\\nSodium 148 , potassium 3.4 , glucose 174 , P02 102 , PC02 115 , PH 7.11 on 40% 02 .\\nBlood urea nitrogen 11 , creatinine .6 , uric acid 3.0 , alkaline phosphatase 78 , creatinine phosphokinase isoenzymes too low , hematocrit 41 , white blood cell count 11.6 .\\nUrine analysis showed 20-50 white blood cells and 3-5 red blood cells .\\nElectrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 123 beats per minute compared to previous electrocardiogram of 1/29 there were no significant changes .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was stabilized in the Medical Intensive Care Unit .\\nHe stayed in the unit for about one day .\\nDuring that period of time he received nebulizer treatments with Albuterol .\\nHe was also started on intravenous Ticarcillin for possible gram negative pneumonia .\\nHe was diuresed with intravenous Lasix to which he responded with at lease a 2L urine output on the first day and 1.5L the second day .\\nAfter one day in the Medical Intensive Care Unit the patient was stable enough to go to the floor where he continued the rest of his treatment .\\nThis consisted of continued nebulizer treatments as well as intravenous antibiotics and intravenous Solu-Medrol .\\nAs the patient 's diuresis continued his respiratory status improved .\\nA chest x-ray showed clearing of the opacities in the chest x-ray that were consistent with pulmonary edema because he continued to have some abnormality in the right lower lobe .\\nThe patient was continued on antibiotics for possible pneumonia .\\nThe antibiotic chosen was Levaquin 500 mg 1 tab per day .\\nThis was started on 4/2/99 and should be continued for ten days .\\nThe Ticarcillin was stopped after two days when it was felt that he did not have a serious pneumonia .\\nThe patient 's respiratory status continued to improve but towards the last 2-3 days of his hospitalization the amount of improvement was minimal .\\nIt was felt that his respiratory status has been maximally treated by then .\\nThe patient 's major improvement came after the first two days with brisk diuresis with Lasix .\\nWhile in the Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital the patient on 4/4/99 complained of mild epigastric discomfort because he was put in Cimetidine while in the Intensive Care Unit for prophylaxis against peptic ulcer disease .\\nThe patient was upgraded to Prilosec 20 mg per day for possible treatment of gastritis or gastroesophageal reflux disease .\\nThe patient did have any nausea , vomiting or evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding .\\nThe patient 's abdominal pain should be followed over the next week or so in case it does not respond to Prilosec .\\nWhile in Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital the patient was never able to get out of bed and walk independently .\\nIt is hoped that when he is transferred to a rehab facility that he will continue with physical therapy to regain his strength and regain independence in activities of daily living .\\nDiscussion with the family regarding the possibility of sending him to a nursing home was entertained however the family strongly refused to allow him to go a nursing home .\\nThey wanted the patient to return to his home after a stay at a rehab facility .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient 's respiratory status was stable .\\nI think his breathing was as good as to be expected with the amount of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease he had .\\nHe needed to go to a rehab facility for continued respiratory therapy and for Physical Therapy to increase his muscle strength .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\n1. Albuterol 2.5 mg in 2.5 normal saline q4h .\\n2. Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously twice a day .\\n3. Ativan .5 mg twice a day .\\n4. Nasal oxygen 3L per minute .\\n5.

Zinc sulfate .\\nALLERGIES :\\nNo known drug allergies .\\nFAMILY HISTORY :\\nPositive for alcoholism .\\nNo history of cancer .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nHe is a World War II veteran and ex-iron worker , has children .\\nDaughter is health care proxy .\\nLives in Ant Sonroeinland Medical Center for several years .\\nGoes to the beach every day .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn admission , he was afebrile at 98.4 .\\nHis heart rate was 94 .\\nHis blood pressure was 160/70 .\\nHe was breathing at 16 .\\nIn general , he was a cachectic older man , lying in bed , breathing deeply , in no distress .\\nHis HEENT exam was notable for pupils equal and reactive to light , anicteric sclera .\\nExtraocular movements were intact .\\nHis dentition was poor and his mucous membranes dry , his neck veins flat .\\nHis carotidpulses were 2+ with a normal contour .\\nHis chest had diffuse expiratory wheezes with diffuse rhonchi worse at the bases bilateral with egophony and mild hyperexpansion and accessory muscle use .\\nHis cardiovascular exam was regular rate and rhythm .\\nHe had a normal S1 and S2 , ? of a I / VI early systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border with no radiation .\\nHe had no S3 .\\nHe had normal S4 .\\nHis abdomen was distended but soft .\\nHe had good bowel sounds .\\nHe had mild right upper quadrant tenderness without rebound or guarding .\\nThe liver span was approximately 7 cm. to percussion .\\nNo spleen tip was felt and there was a small quantity of shifting dullness .\\nHis groin exam was notable for strong femoral pulses bilaterally .\\nThe extremities were notable for a right great toe amputation which was well healed .\\nNo popliteal pulses but his feet were warm with strong radial pulses .\\nNo edema was detected .\\nNeurologically , he was alert and oriented x 3 .\\nHis pupils were equal and reactive to light .\\nHis had no asterixis .\\nHis cranial nerves II through XII were intact .\\nHis strength was 5/5 throughout with normal light touch .\\nHis reflexes were 2+ and symmetric and Babinski was non-responsive .\\nHis skin exam , he has a hematoma over hisleft hip , multiple ecchymosis over the hands , forearms , no spiderangiomata , no palmar erythema and no evidence of jaundice .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nOn admission , sodium of 138 , potassium of 4.8 , chloride of 103 , bicarb of 24 , BUN of 26 , creatinine of 1.6 , glucose of 346 .\\nHis white blood cell count was 4.8 .\\nHis platelets were 314 .\\nHis hematocrit 20.5 .\\nHis had an MCV of 83 .\\nHis chest x-ray showed mild hypoinflation bilaterally and normal cardiac silhouette , no opacities and no evidence of pulmonary edema .\\nHis EKG had normal axis , normal intervals , no LVH or RVH , tiny Q \\'s in V3 through V6 , no T wave inversions or other indications of acute ischemia .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\\nOur impression was this was a 73 year old man with cirrhosis , portal hypertension , hepatocellular carcinoma , hepatitis C , history of alcoholism in the past , history of peptic ulcer disease on aspirin without acid blockade who presented with an upper GI bleed with multiple esophageal and gastric varices .\\nHis portal hypertension resulting in a ruptured varices was almost certainly his cause of bleed .\\nThere was no evidence of ulcers on endoscopy .\\nHis bleed also might have been precipitated by med non-compliance versus other causes of increased blood pressure such as increased salt intake .\\nThe temporal proximity to paracentesis was initially worrisome for an underlying infection without precipitating hemodynamic imbalance , although no evidence of infection was established with any sputum , paracentesis culture or blood culture .\\nGiven the extent of hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis of cancer , the risk of worsening obstruction to portal venous flow versus ____________ was also increased .\\nHe was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit while his initial care that first night was , by system :\\nNeurologically , given the risk of hepatic encephalopathy with the recent GI bleed , he was put on lactulose 30 cc. PO titrated to 4 loose stools per day .\\nCardiovascularly , he was hypertensive by report on admission and TNG drip , Lasix , Aldactone and propranolol was instigated to keep his systolic blood pressure between 100 and 120 .\\nRhythm wise , he was in normal sinus rhythm , no issues .\\nHis PR interval was watched as propranolol was started .\\nThere was no evidence of ischemia .\\nPulmonary wise , he had some wheezing on exam .\\nHe was treated with inhalers .\\nThere was a suggestion of pneumonia on exam , but not on chest x-ray .\\nGI wise , he underwent status post banding x 5 for bleeding esophageal varices .\\nHe was kept NPO .\\nHe was started originally on propranolol and then switched to metoprolol as he experienced some wheezing in order to decrease his portal pressure .\\nHe was also started on triatide , omeprazole .\\nIn terms of Hem wise , he had experienced an approximately 12 point crit drop with this bleed .\\nFor this , he was given 6 units of FFP , 4 units of packed red blood cells and platelets were kept greater than 60 with transfusion of platelets .\\nHe was also given Vitamin K 10 mg. PO x 3 days .\\nHe was treated with Pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis .\\nHe was kept in the Medical Intensive Care Unit for 24 hours during which time , his hematocrit remained stable and he had no other signs of continued GI bleed .\\nAt that point , he was transferred to Carespistown Hospital for further management .\\nOn his second day of admission , there was a concern about a developing pneumonia based on a worsening lung exam and also worsening cough , although sputum and all blood cultures remained negative for pathogens and the patient did not have a temperature spike .\\nDespite this , he was started on Levoflox 250 mg. PO QD on March 18th as well as Flagyl 500 mg. IV TID for the possibility of an emerging aspiration pneumonia .\\nThe major therapeutic concern on the floor was diuresis .\\nHis Aldactone was gradually titrated up to a maximum dose of 400 mg. per day divided in three even doses .\\nIn addition , Lasix was added on to help him with diuresis .\\nBetween March 20th and March 25th , he lost approximately 7 pounds on this regimen .\\nHowever , after Lasix was added back on , his creatinine rose from approximately 1.4 up to 1.7 and Lasix was held for 24 hours .\\nAt that time , a dose of 20 mg. IV BID was re-instigated .\\nOn the 400 mg. of Aldactone , his potassium remained in the high normal range around 5.0 .\\nTherefore , on March 25th , his Aldactone was decreased to 100 mg. PO TID and Lasix was kept at 20 mg. BID .\\nOn this regimen , his weight remained approximately stable .\\nHe was also kept on a low salt diet .\\nHe was also kept on a 2 liter per day fluid restriction .\\nBy March 26 , 1998 , he was ready to discharged back to Ant Sonroeinland Medical Center , although he would stay in the Medical Unit there before returning back to his own room .\\nAt discharge , the active issues still to be dealt with at Ant Sonroeinland Medical Center are :\\n1. Necessity of daily electrolytes and creatinine monitoring as his diuretic regimen was optimized .\\nAt discharge , he was on 100 mg. Aldactone TID and 20 mg. of Lasix BID but with potassium running in the high normal range necessitating daily electrolyte checks while the exact ratio of Lasix to Aldactone was optimized .\\n2. He also needs daily weight checks and daily abdominal exam to evaluate his fluid status .\\n3. He also needs TID fingerstick glucose to monitor his blood sugar .\\n4. In terms of his antibiotics , he has 4 days left of his Flagyl 500 mg. q8hours .\\nFor SBP prophylaxis , he should be left indefinitely on Levoflox 250 mg. PO QD .\\n5. He should be enforced on a no concentrated sugars , low salt diet .\\n6. He also should have a 2 liter fluid restriction , if possible .\\n7. He should have initially twice a week checks of his hematocrit to make sure that his GI bleeding has stabilized .\\nFOLLOW UP :\\n1. He will follow up with his primary care physician , Dr. Portal , at Ant Sonroeinland Medical Center .\\nDoctor Portal has been notified of the patient \\'s progress at Tecal Galecounxopt Community Hospital .\\n2. From our GI Service , the patient will follow up with Dr. Shufftakeaakote and follow up will be arranged in GI Clinic for next week .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\n1. Prilosec 20 mg. PO BID .\\n2. Zinc sulfate 220 mg. PO QD .\\n3. Isordil 10 mg. PO TID .\\n4. Lopressor 12.5 mg. PO BID .\\n5. Levoflox 250 mg. PO QD .\\n6. Atrovent nebs q8hours .\\n7. Flagyl 500 mg. IV TID to stop on 3/31/1998 .\\n8. Albuterol q4hour nebulizer treatments .\\n9. Lactulose 30 cc. PO BID .\\n10. Aldactone 100 mg. PO TID titrated to potassium .\\n11. Lasix 20 mg. PO BID .\\n12. NPH Insulin 14 units subq in the morning , 10 units subq in the evening as well as additional CZI Insulin based on TID fingersticks .\\nADDENDUM :\\nUnfortunately patient could not be discharged on 3/28/98 because , in the context of starting his Lasix , his creatinine bumped overnight from 1.7 to 2.2 , possibly because of a progression of his hepatorenal syndrome .\\nHis potassium also climbed to 5.1 .\\nBecause of this , we held all of his diuretics , namely his Lasix and Aldactone .\\nDespite holding his Aldactone , his potassium continued to rise over the course of the next two days .\\nIt went as high as 5.8 on 3/29/98 .\\nHe was treated with Kayexalate b.i.d. 30 gm. as treatment for this .\\nBy 3/31/98 his potassium had gone down to 4.0 .\\nWe then restarted a much smaller dose of Aldactoneat 50 mg. PO Q day .\\nThis was the dose of Aldactone he had originally been admitted with .\\nOn 3/31/98 the junior resident on Drugway Hospital , Dr. Asaleysean Portal , had an extensive conversation with the patient about his future medical care .\\nPatient was very clear that he did not want any extraordinary measures done in case of acute illness .\\nSpecifically he did not want to be intubated or have any of the ACLS protocol in the case of acardiac or pulmonary arrest .\\nHe also was very adamant that if he was to rapidly GI bleed , as from an esophageal bleed , that he did not want any extraordinary measures taken .\\nSpecifically he did not want to be re-banded .\\nWe also addressed the possibility of having the GI service re-endoscope him in a few weeks to look at the progression of his esophageal banding .\\nHe said that he did not feel that that made any sense given his other comorbid disease .\\nThe patient was very adamant that in the future he would prefer to stay at the Southnyra Erwill*te Cinee Memorial Hospital where he is in residence .\\nDr. Asaleysean Portal spoke with Dr. Fat of the Ant Sonroeinland Medical Center about this and that residence will make it clear that patient is not to be transferred back to an acute care facility in the case of decompensation .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nlactulose 30 cc \\'s PO b.i.d. , Prilosec 20 mg. PO b.i.d. , zinc sulfate 220 mg. PO Q day , Isordil 10 mg. PO t.i.d. , Metoprolol 12.5 mg. PO b.i.d. , Levofloxacin 250 mg. PO Q day , Atrovent nebs Q8 hours , Albuterol nebs Q8 hours , and Flagyl 500 mg. IV Q8 hours with the last day 4/1/98 .\\nPatient will need no further antibiotics in his nursing home .\\nHe was also on Aldactone 50 mg. PO Q day .\\nWe decided to discontinue his Lasixas this had resulted in increase in his creatinine .\\nAt the Southnyra Erwill*te Cinee Memorial Hospital he will need daily weights as well as daily lytes , specifically potassium , BUN and creatinine to make sure that he can safely tolerate this dose of Aldactone .\\nHe should also have a low salt , low potassium diet without concentrated sweets and 2 liter fluid restriction .\\nHe will also need t.i.d. fingerstick glucose and he will follow up with Dr. Fat at Southnyra Erwill*te Cinee Memorial Hospital .\\nASALEYSEAN ILON PORTAL , M.D. ,

directed .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient is a 72 year old male with a history of coronary artery disease .\\nHe had experienced three myocardial infarctions since 1988 .\\nHe presented with sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in December , 1994 and was admitted to Tecal Galecounxopt Community Hospital .\\nThe coronary angiogram performed during his hospitalization had revealed 95% of left anterior descending artery disease and diffuse left circumflex disease .\\nAn echocardiogram had revealed an ejection fraction of 41% with apicalakinesis .\\nHe had undergone electrophysiology study and his incessant ventricular tachycardia was interrupted by transcatheter radio frequency ablation .\\nAfter the ablation procedure , programmed stimulation had initiated another ventricular tachycardia with distinct surface QRS configuration but since there was no spontaneous ventricular tachycardia , the other forms were not pursued vigorously .\\nThe patient was discharged while on procainamide and Coumadin .\\nOn March 8 , he developed palpitations with shortness of breath and chest pain .\\nThe patient was admitted to an outside hospital in Xingwa Moineswest where a wide complex tachycardia with a rate of 160 beats per minute was demonstrated .\\nThe tachycardia had not responded to intravenous lidocaine or procainamide but has responded to intravenous verapamil .\\nThe patient was transferred to Tecal Galecounxopt Community Hospital for further evaluation .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nThe past medical history is notable for hypertension , left ventricular aneurysm and deep venous thrombosis which he experienced one month ago after the radio frequency ablation .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn admission physical examination , he was a well developed , well nourished elderly man in slightly dyspneic and uncomfortable condition .\\nHis blood pressure was 130/80 millimeters of mercury , and pulse was 80 beats per minute .\\nThe carotids were 2+ on both sides with bruits on each side .\\nThe jugular venous pressure was 7 centimeters .\\nLung examination revealed crackling rales over the bases of both lungs .\\nCardiovascular exam :\\nnormal Sl and S2 .\\nThe abdomen was benign .\\nExtremities :\\nno clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe chest X-ray showed mild cardiomegaly .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to the Step Down Unit .\\nThe patient continued to experience multiple episodes of sustained and nonsustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia .\\nIntravenous procainamide was started , which reduced the frequency and the duration of the ventricular tachycardia .\\nOn March 11 , the patient underwent an electrophysiology study .\\nDuring the study , ventricular tachycardia with a cycle length of 510 milliseconds was reproducibly induced by extra stimuli delivered from the right ventricular apex .\\nPace mapping studies had demonstrated that the origin of the tachycardia to be in the inferior , lateral and apical left ventricle .\\nAfter mapping of the tachycardia , radio frequency ablation was carried out with four current applications , terminating the ventricular tachycardia in three of the four times .\\nAfter radio frequency ablation , no sustained ventricular tachycardias occurred .\\nHowever , there were periods of supraventricular tachycardias with a rate of 160-180 beats per minute and the patient was placed on sotalol .\\nSince the patient was known to have multiple different ventricular tachycardias , automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator therapy was also offered to the patient .\\nThe patient agreed to proceed with automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator therapy .\\nOn March 17 , the patient was taken to the Pacemaker Laboratory and a transvenous lead for the automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator ( CPI Endotak C 0074 ) was placed .\\nThen , the patient was transferred to the operating room and a Ventak PRX model 1705

( interval unspecified ) , Prozac 40 mg. po q.day , Lovestatin 20 mg. po bid , aspirin q. day and supplemental potassium .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nRemarkable for an oriented , alert male in no acute distress with decreased breath sounds at the right base consistent with effusion and a 3/6 systolic murmur consistent with aortic stenosis .\\nHis pulse exam was intact .\\nCardiac catheterization demonstrated elevated right and left-sided filling pressures at rest , with pulmonary hypertension and normal cardiac index .\\nThere was severe aortic stenosis of 70 millimeter peak gradient , native three vessel disease with patent left internal mammary artery graft to the left circumflex , dissection of the left main was induced by the catheter tip .\\nA patent right internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery and diagonal was noted , and a patent saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery was present .\\nAlso of note , pulmonary edema was induced by dye and anxiety and treated with Lasix , Morphine , oxygen and nitroglycerin .\\nPost-procedure he was admitted to the CCU because of the history of left main dissection .\\nHe remained hemodynamically stable but of note , would not tolerate a transesophageal echo because of anxiety-he would not swallow the probe .\\nTransthoracic echo demonstrated gradients of 100 peak and 65 mean across the aortic valve and there was mild aortic insufficiency and ejection fraction was noted to be 18% with global hypokinesis .\\nThe next several days were remarkable for events in which the patient was quite agitated and was evaluated by Psychiatry and treated with Ativan .\\nThe patient was then evaluated by Cardiac Surgery for probable re-do aortic valve replacement and possible re-do coronary artery bypass grafting .\\nIn the course of preoperative workup , Mr. Has was evaluated completely by Psychiatry with diagnoses including underlying chronic depression well-controlled on Prozac , underlying organ brain vulnerability of unclear etiology , possibly microvascular infarct , acute paranoid and belligerent behavior , possibly due to medications .\\nOn December 12 the patient underwent surgery , including a re-do aortic valve replacement with # 25 St. Jude and re-do coronary artery bypass grafting times one ; saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery as a veno-venous jump graft .\\nThe total bypass time :\\n2 hours 25 minutes .\\nTotal crossclamp time :\\n1 hour and 48 minutes .\\nThe patient was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively with stable hemodynamics on Lidocaine at one , Dobutamine at 200 and Nipride .\\nThe patient was extubated by postoperative day # 1 but was noted to be relatively hypoxemic with high oxygen requirement .\\nChest x-ray demonstrating pulmonary edema .\\nAggressive diuresis was undertaken and the patient responded , albeit sluggishly .\\nIn addition , he remained agitated .\\nThis was attributed to mild hypoxia and / or his underlying psychiatric diagnoses and he was treated with Haldol appropriately .\\nOn day # 2 the patient continued to diurese and this was maintained with the Lasix/ Mannitol infusion .\\nHis urine output remained at 150 to 200 cc. an hour .\\nDespite this , his chest x-ray continued to show severe pulmonary edema and the clinical picture correlated .\\nHe required anti-hypertensive therapy initially with Nipride which was changed to Hydralazine to avoid shunting .\\nHe received several units of packed red blood cells to increase his hematocrit and oncotic pressure .\\nVery early in the morning on postoperative day # 3 , the patient became acutely hypoxic after several hours of marginal oxygenation with respiratory rates in the thirties and the patient was urgently intubated , without complication .\\nWith positive pressure ventilation and continued diuresis , his arterial blood gases improved .\\nThroughout this he remained hemodynamically stable .\\nException was a ten beat run of ventricular tachycardia which was thought to be ischemic in origin and treated with nitrates and Lidocaine .\\nHis chest x-ray blossomed to demonstrate pulmonary infiltrate and the patient began to produce sputum .\\nInfectious Disease consultation was obtained for evaluation of his purulent sputum and the patient was covered with Vancomycin , Ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\\nCardiology evaluation commented on the patient 's increasing ventricular ectopy and suggested that these were due to an R and T phenomenon from his pacer in the setting of prolonged QT interval .\\nConsequently his Pronestyl was discontinued .\\nIn addition , the patient was given magnesium to bring his level above 2 .\\nOn the evening of the 18th , the patient continued to remain hemodynamically stable , although his oxygenation was clearly deteriorating and more marginal .\\nOn 60% FIO2 his pO2 was 63 .\\nIt was increased to 65% with pO2 of 81 .\\nAt approximately 7:50 a.m. , house officer was called to the room for blood pressure of 70/40 with falling oxygen saturations .\\nThe patient was immediately given 400 mg. of Calcium Chloride i.v. push and ventilator disconnected and the patient manually ventilated .\\nWithin one minute , the patient lost his blood pressure and CPR was initiated and code was called .\\nThe patient initially continued to have rhythm consistent with EMV and he was bolused with Levophed and given some volume while compressions continued .\\nThe patient 's prothrombin time had been 23 early the same morning and tamponade was considered and thoracotomy instruments obtained .\\nThe chest was opened partially and through sub-xyphoid area it was determined that there was no evidence of tamponade .\\nCompressions were continued and adequate pulse was felt and arterial blood gases demonstrated adequate oxygenation and perfusion .\\nThe patient 's rhythm degenerated to ventricular tachycardia and he was shocked , initially without response but after several doses of Epinephine , one-half mg. of Atropine and a bolus of Lidocaine we were able to obtain a blood pressure and rhythm only briefly , and quickly deteriorated back to ventricular fibrillation .\\nFurther attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful and the patient was pronounced dead at 8:30 a.m.\\nThe family has been notified and autopsy consent has been obtained .\\nLENNI BREUTZOLN , M.D.\\nTR :\\nbp / bmot\\nDD :\\n12/17/93\\nTD :\\n12/18/93\\nCC :\\nG Hemp , M.D. Taarnna Has , M.D.\\n[ report_end ]\\n</TEXT>\",

diagnosis as above was a left brachial embolus .\\nThe postoperative diagnosis , the same .\\nThe procedure was a left brachial embolectomy .\\nThe surgeon was Dr. Home and first assistant Dr. Home .\\nThe findings were a thromboembolism with propagated clot in the left brachial artery .\\nThere were no complications .\\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well and returned to the floor soon after the procedure .\\nOn postoperative day # 1 the patient was afebrile with stable vitals and he had a very strong left radial pulse and a warm hand .\\nHe was heparinized postoperatively and a cardiology consult was obtained .\\nIn addition echocardiography for the next day was arranged .\\nThe patient was seen on 5-29-92 by the ward cardiology consult .\\nHis assessment was that this was a 76 year old gentleman with atrial fibrillation and a dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy status post two embolic / thrombotic phenomena with a recent history of an upper gastrointestinal bleed .\\nHe recommended that the patient be heparinized as the Scabeth T Hospital Surgery Team had already done and that Coumadinization be begun within a few days of heparinization .\\nThese recommendations were already underway .\\nConsequently we simply continued our management .\\nThe cardiology consult also spoke to the patient 's primary medical doctor , Dr. Blood in Clear La who related that the patient had had two large esophageal ulcers and a history of polycythemia vera in the past .\\nOn 5-30-92 the patient 's gastroenterologist Dr. Ri Blood was contacted .\\nDr. Blood was on vacation , however Dr. Kotethorereke , his partner was in the office and went through Mr. Flytheleungfyfe 's old chart and noted that Dr. Blood had performed esophagogastroduodenoscopy on the patient during his North Carolina admission for an acute upper gastrointestinal bleed .\\nDuring this time in January of 1992 Dr. Blood had noted two distal esophageal ulcers .\\nHe had treated both of these with epinephrine injection .\\nFollow up endoscopy on Mar 15 , 1992 had shown two deformities in the distal esophagus corresponding to the presence of esophageal ulcers treated earlier in January .\\nThere was also a 4 cm. hiatus hernia from 36 cm. to 40 cm .\\nThe stomach and duodenum were otherwise normal .\\nFrom Dr. Blood 's standpoint on Mar 15 , 1992 there was no contraindication to Coumadinization .\\nWe discussed Coumadinization with Dr. Blood and noting Dr. Blood 's earlier findings we , in conjunction with Dr. Blood decided to Coumadinize the patient and Coumadinization was begun on 5-30-92 .\\nIt was noted at that time that a stable dose for the patient earlier when he had been Coumadinized before was 5 mg. po q.day .\\nThat was concurrent with Albuterol 150 mg. po q.day .\\nGiven the patient 's history of ulcer and hiatus hernia and the fact that we did wish to anticoagulate the patient we actually performed upper endoscopy on the patient on 5-31-92 .\\nThe findings were as follows .\\nThe principal operating surgeon was Dr. Ca Scgach with the assistance of Dr. Jesclinke .\\nThe principal findings were a 5.0 cm. hiatal hernia and apparent Ingree and Ot of Weamanshy Medical Center 's esophagus distally .\\nIn the stomach there were mild erosions of the gastroesophageal junction without other abnormalities .\\nThere were no abnormalities into the second portion of the duodenum .\\nThe overall impression was that there was an apparent healed esophageal ulcer , a hiatus hernia , an esophageal mucosal changes distally were consistent with a Barrett 's esophagus .\\nNo biopsy was taken .\\nThe biopsy was deferred because the patient had received a dose of Coumadin the night before and had a prothrombin time of approximately 15 before the procedure .\\nOn 6-1-92 the patient went to the echocardiography suite .\\nFindings were :\\nthere was no evidence of intracardiac thrombus , although this was a transcardiac echocardiogram which is not the best technique for visualizing intraatrial thrombus .\\nThere was a thickened mitral leaflet with mild mitral regurgitation .\\nThere was focal calcification in the mitral annulus .\\nThe aortic leaflets were thickened with no aortic stenosis .\\nThere was trace aortic insufficiency .\\nThe aorta at the sinuses was ectactic at 42 millimeters .\\nThe left ventricular size and function were within normal limits with a left ventricular ejection fractio n of 57 percent .\\nThere was trace tricuspid insufficiency .\\nThere was evidence of an old pacer wire in the right atrium .\\nThere was trace pulmonary insufficiency with right ventricular systolic blood pressure of 35 millimeters .\\nThere was paradoxical septal motion consistent with bundle branch block .\\nThe patient , it should be noted at this time , was doing very well and he was taking regular diet , voiding spontaneously .\\nHe had been therapeutically heparinized since going to the operating room and by 6-2-92 his prothrombin time was beginning to elevate .\\nOn 6-2-92 he presented a new complaint with left wrist swelling and pain .\\nHe confessed to a history of gout in the past and consequently Rheumatology consult was obtained .\\nThe Rheumatologist entertained gout as an attractive diagnosis given his history and they aspirated the joint .\\nJoint aspirate was remarkable for calcium phosphate crystals , that is the patient actually had a case of pseudo-gout .\\nJoint aspirate that was sent for culture has been negative to date and today is 6-4-92 .\\nThe rheumatologist recommended checking a wrist xray to rule out calcification .\\nA wrist xray was obtained of the left wrist and it did show chondrocalcinosis thus confirming the diagnosis of pseudo-gout .\\nThe patient 's pseudogout was treated with Colchicine 0.6 mg. po q. 3 hours and he received nine such doses over a time span of about 42 hours with some relief of his symptoms .\\nHe is being discharged on Colchicine 0.6 mg. PO t.i.d. as an acute measure for his pseudo-gout and that prescription will last until he sees Dr. Blood in follow up this coming Tuesday .\\nToday , on 6-4-92 , the patient has no new complaint .\\nYesterday , on 6-3-92 , his prothrombin time was just a bit over 16 , between 16 and 17 and consequently his heparin was discontinued .\\nToday his prothrombin time is 16.7 and it looks like 5 mg. of Coumadin per day is going to be a stable dose for him .\\nConsequently , he is ready for discharge today .\\nThe only other thing of note is that secondary to his anticoagulation with Coumadin his Ecotrin has been discontinued .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nIsordil 10 mg. PO t.i.d.\\nDitropan 5 mg. po q.i.d.\\nCimetidine 400 mg. PO b.i.d.\\nOmeprazole 20 mg. PO b.i.d.\\nColchicine 0.6 mg. PO t.i.d.\\nPercocet 1 tablet po q. 4 to 6 hours prn and Coumadin 5 mg. po q.day .\\nDISPOSITION :\\nThe patient is being discharged to home today 9-1-25 .\\nHis plans for follow up include a return to the Maza Alllarow Healthcare Surgery Clinic on 6-21-92 , that is two and a half weeks from the day of discharge ( 6-4-92 ) .\\nHe is to see his primary medical doctor , Dr. Telshey Swatlleebtik in Ki Ave , Sapo on Tuesday , June 7 , 1992 , that is this coming Tuesday .\\nIt has been a pleasure serving Mr. Flytheleungfyfe and taking care of him .\\nHe is a very pleasant gentleman and it has also been a pleasure to deal with his primary medical doctor , Dr. Blood who is very accessible .\\nTOMEDANKELL FLOWAYLES , M.D.\\nTR :\\nag / bmot\\nDD :\\n6-4-92\\nTD :\\n06/07/92\\nCC :\\nDR.

Neathe is a 73 year old Gravida 6 Para 4 abortions 2 with a background history of stage IIIC papillary serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary who presents on 5/30/94 for failure to thrive , right lower lobe pneumonia and obstructive uropathy .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient was diagnosed with ovarian carcinoma in the summer of 1992 when she presented with abdominal distention .\\nAt that time she was taken to the operating room and an ileostomy and colectomy performed .\\nThe admission was complicated by the development of a right calf deep venous thrombosis on postoperative day four .\\nThe patient was referred then to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital where she underwent thrombectomy .\\nOne month later the patient was readmitted to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for definitive debulking including total abdominal hysterectomy , bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy , omentectomy , splenectomy and ileostomy take-down by Dr. Slaineaee Chabechird .\\nThereafter she underwent line 1 chemotherapy with cis platinum , VP16 which she received six cycles and which was completed in March of 1993 .\\nThis course of chemotherapy was complicated only by persistent diarrhea and some nausea and vomiting .\\nOn 4/28/94 the patient developed a left femoral deep venous thrombosis requiring admission for anticoagulation .\\nAn abdominopelvic computerized tomography scan during that admission showed recurrent disease in the pelvis with bilateral hydronephrosis .\\nBilateral ureteric stents were placed prior to discharge .\\nTwo days following discharge , however , the patient was admitted to Sephsandpot Center because of a decreased urinary output and persistent nausea and vomiting and anorexia .\\nShe was maintained on intravenous fluids and received a transfusion of Prilosec which helped her urinary obstruction .\\nOn this regimen she showed good improvement and was discharge home .\\nShe was then seen on 5/30/94 at Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for a routine chemotherapy but complained of decreased urinary output , nausea and vomiting and poor appetite and was therefore admitted .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nIs as detailed above .\\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY :\\nShe is also status post appendectomy in 1944 and dilation and curettage in 1945 .\\nALLERGIES :\\nShe is allergic to shellfish .\\nDRUG ALLERGIES :\\nShe has no known drug allergies .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nInclude Coumadin 2.5 mg. P.O. q.h.s. , omeprazole 20 mg. P.O. q.d. , M.V.I. one tablet P.O. q.d. , ferrous sulfate 325 mg. P.O. b.i.d. , Ativan .5 mg. P.O. q.h.s. p.r.n. for sleep and Tylenol No. 3 one to two tablets P.O. 4 hourly for pain .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\n( on admission ) showed the patient to be low-grade febrile with temperature of 99.6 , vital signs were stable with a blood pressure of 104/68 and a pulse of 92 , respiratory rate 16 .\\nShe was noted to be a thin , cachectic woman in no apparent distress .\\nHead and neck examination remarkable only for extreme dry mucous membranes consistent with dehydration .\\nShe had slightly icteric sclera , no adenopathy or thyromegaly .\\nLungs examination was unremarkable with no focal pathology , breasts were within normal limits .\\nHeart :\\nregular rate and rhythm , no evidence of evidence , cardiac failure or endocarditis .\\nAbdomen :\\nshowed well healed midline scar , non-distended , non-tender , bowel sounds were good , multiple small nodules were palpated subcutaneously in the upper abdomen which was non-tender , there was no costovertebral angle tenderness .\\nPelvic and rectal examinations confirmed recurrence of tumor mass in the pelvis .\\nThe patient was occult blood negative .\\nExtremities :\\nshowed no evidence of acute deep venous thrombosis .\\nHowever , left leg had two plus pitting edema to the knee whereas the right leg had minimal edema .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\n( on admission ) showed sodium 119 , potassium 9.8 ( the specimen was hemolyzed ) BUN and creatinine of 26 and 2.3 respectively , glucose 104 , ALT was 13 , total bilirubin .5 , alkaline phosphatase 62 , white blood cell count was 17.7 , hematocrit 26.7 , platelet count 223,000 , prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were 22.1 and 37 respectively .\\nI and R was 5.2. Urinalysis showed no white blood cells and few bacteria .\\nChest x-ray from 5/18/94 was within normal limits .\\nIN SUMMARY :\\nThe patient was assessed as a 72 year old woman with a background of stage IIIC ovarian carcinoma and documented local recurrence who presents for line 2 of cycle 1 chemotherapy with Adriamycin , Ifex and MESNA .\\nShe also has a low-grade fever of unknown etiology , has a background history of deep venous thrombosis and is therefore currently on anticoagulation and she shows evidence of dehydration and failure to thrive .\\nIt was decided at that time to hold off with the chemotherapy .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was therefore admitted to the GYN / Oncology Service under the care of Dr. Chabechird .\\nLaboratory tests were repeated in view of some of the above abnormalities and was remarkable for sodium 138 , potassium 4.0 , BUN and creatinine remained elevated at 36 and 2.8 respectively .\\nUrinalysis showed 10-20 white blood cells .\\nIn view of the nausea and vomiting a nasogastric tube was placed to which the patient some relief .\\nRepeat chest x-ray showed evidence of right lower lobe pneumonia .\\nRenal ultrasound was performed which showed moderate right and severe left hydronephrosis , bilateral ureteric stents were visualized .\\nDr. Ryna R. Jescdrig from the Urology Service was consulted in view of the above findings .\\nHe requested a Lasix renal nuclear medicine scan which showed high-grade obstruction of both kidneys , left greater than right and minimal clearance with Lasix .\\nNeither kidney appeared to be completely obstructed .\\nIn view of these results with the elevated white blood count , elevated creatinine , Dr. Jescdrig felt that the patient was inadequately stented .\\nAs a result she was taken back to the operating room on 6/2/94 and under cystoscopy the old stents were removed and new larger stents were placed .\\nThe patient was started on Ampicillin and Gentamicin for urinary tract infection which ultimately grew out Escherichia coli sensitive to the above antibiotics and for right lower lobe pneumonia on x-ray .\\nShe was started on nebulizers around-the-clock and chest physical therapy .\\nSputum culture was sent but failed to identify an infective organism .\\nOn the above regimen the patient showed marked improvement .\\nHer urinary output remained good at 80-100 ccs. per hour .\\nHowever , her BUN and creatinine remained elevated .\\nOn 6/5/94 they were 21 and 2.2 respectively .\\nHer Coumadin anticoagulation was adjusted to give a prothrombin time between 16 and 18 and an I and R of 2.5-3 .\\nOn June 5 , 1994 it was decided that Mrs. Neathe was not stable enough with a line 2 cycle I chemotherapy with Ifex , Adriamycin and MESNA .\\nShe was therefore well hydrated and was started on her chemotherapy .\\nIn view of her kidney damage it was suggested to change her intravenous antibiotics from Ancef and Gentamicin to Ancef and ciprofloxacin which she tolerated well .\\nOn 6/7/94 the patient was found to be mildly confused with persistent nausea and malaise .\\nUrinary electrolytes were noted to be within normal limits but her confusion persisted .\\nA Neuro-Oncology consult was sought which felt this was probably secondary to Ifex intoxication and her chemotherapy was stopped .\\nAn electroencephalogram was requested and was negative .\\nNo computerized tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging study of the head was performed .\\nShe continued to have persistent nausea and vomiting with large amount of drainage through the nasogastric tube between 1200 and 1500 ccs. for 24 hours .\\nOff her Ifex the patient 's sensorium slowly cleared but the nausea and vomiting persisted .\\nFor this reason a barium study was performed on 6/12/94 which showed a fixed stricture at the anastomosis of the descending colon with the rectum .\\nThe mucosa appeared to be preserved .\\nIn addition there was some narrowing in the mid portion of the descending colon .\\nThe patient 's white blood count which had been followed carefully began to drop precipitously on 6/11/94 and nadired down to 0.7 on 6/12/94 .\\nThe patient was placed on neutropenic precautions , her intravenous antibiotics were continued .\\nHer sensorium had cleared .\\nBecause of persistent nausea and vomiting on June 13 , 1994 a KUB and upright was requested which showed large amounts of retained barium confirming a rectosigmoid stricture approximately one centimeter in diameter .\\nThe patient 's white blood count persisted in the region of .5 to .6 with an ANC of 60 for the next two to three days .\\nIn addition her platelets began to drop and reach a level on 6/13/94 .\\nShe was maintained on intravenous antibiotics and GCSF therapy was started because of the profound neutropenia .\\nDespite the low platelets the patient showed no evidence of active bleeding and was not transfused .\\nA Gastrograffin upper gastrointestinal was attempted on 6/14/94 but was unsuccessful due to nausea and vomiting .\\nOn conservative therapy the patient 's nausea and vomiting has slowly subsided .\\nA percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy ( PEG ) tube was placed on June 18 , 1994 which has helped to decompress the stomach and prevent nausea and vomiting .\\nOn 6/17/94 in view of a drop in hematocrit to 25 , the patient was transfused three units of packed red blood cells , white count however had increased to 8.5 and her platelets were on their way up , count was 74,000 .\\nAnd she was not given platelets in addition .\\nThroughout this period the patient 's pain remained well controlled on patient controlled analgesia .\\nAfter much discussion with the family and Social Services it was decided to transfer the patient home once stable .\\nOn August 21 , 1994 a PICC line was placed to facilitate home patient controlled analgesia ( PCA ) and on 6/23/94 this was found to be correctly positioned on chest x-ray .\\nOn June 23 , 1994 the patient was found to be mobilizing relatively well with few episodes of nausea and vomiting .\\nThe PEG tube was found to be draining well .\\nShe was discharged home in a stable condition into the care of her family .\\nIn addition she will be followed by Sephsandpot Center and Dwardsc Center who will arrange for home PCA ( patient controlled analgesia ) .\\nThe patient 's prognosis is guarded .\\nHer current code status is do not resuscitate ( DNR ) .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nInclude omeprazole 20 mg. P.O. q.d. , Timoptic eye drops .5 percent one drop OU b.i.d.\\nShe will receive intravenous fluids D5 1/2 normal saline plus 20 of potassium at 110 ccs / hour at home and is going to be placed on a subcutaneous morphine pump as arranged by Sephsandpot Center .\\nThe patient may have liquids as tolerated but no solid foods .\\nIn addition she will be followed by Santea Gehawhi General Hospital for PEG tube care and flushing and to assess her pain control .\\nFOLLOW-UP :\\nThe patient will follow up with Dr. Chabechird on an out-patient basis .\\nLONGKEND SAPSHUFF , M.D.\\nDICTATING FOR :\\nSLAINEAEE S.

84-year-old man who was admitted with decompensated heart failure .\\nThe patient has a long standing history of significant left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe mitral regurgitation and moderate aortic stenosis .\\nHe was recently hospitalized at the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for repeat cardiac catheterization .\\nAfter a comprehensive assessment , Drs. Sieh and Shufffyfe did not recommend operative repair of severe mitral regurgitation or aortic stenosis .\\nHe was thus discharged with plans for continued medical therapy of his coronary artery disease .\\nUnfortunately , the patient continued to deteriorate and was readmitted for an attempt at hemodynamic tailoring and possible inotropic support .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nIs notable for above .\\nFor long standing dilated cardiomyopathy , severe mitral regurgitation and moderate aortic stenosis with a calculated aortic valve area of 1.1 by previous catheterization .\\nThe patient had limited coronary artery disease with an occluded right coronary artery collateralized from the left system .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nThe patient was a well appearing pleasant man who was dyspneic on the examining table .\\nInitial blood pressure was 95/65 , heart rate 80 and regular .\\nRespiratory rate was 14 .\\nJugular venous pressure was 7 with modest hepatojugular reflex .\\nThe carotids were 2+ and the lungs were notable for diminished breath sounds with inspiratory rhonchi .\\nThe point of maximum impulse was displaced and the first and second heart sounds were unremarkable with a 2/6 murmur of mitral regurgitation .\\nThere was no S3 gallop .\\nAbdomen was soft and non-tender and the rest of the examination was notable only for a slightly diminished pulses and poor perfusion .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nNotable for a sodium of 144 , potassium 3.7 , BUN 43 , creatinine 1.8 , albumin 3.0 , hematocrit 36 , white count 9.5 , platelet count 254 and a negative urinalysis .\\nA chest x-ray revealed moderate cardiomegaly with modest edema and the electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm with left axis deviation , previous inferior apical infarct and right bundle branch block .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\\nThe patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent right heart catheterization which revealed a right atrial pressure of 11 , pulmonary artery pressure of 55/25 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 26 and a cardiac output of 2.7 liters per minute .\\nThe PA line was kept in place while the patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit where he underwent an attempt at hemodynamic tailoring .\\nInitially Nipride was begun with some augmentation of the cardiac index but eventually a fall of the cardiac index to 1.8 .\\nThe patient was then begun on Milrinone to a dose of .4 mcg. per kg. per minute with improvement in his cardiac index to approximately 2.0 and a corresponding fall in his filling pressures .\\nBecause of the increased ectopy that appeared to be temporally associated with this infusion , the patient was switched to Dobutamine and titrated to a dose of 250 mcg. per minute .\\nOn Dobutamine the cardiac index was 2.4-2.7 and at the end of his hemodynamic tailoring which included vigorous diuresis and the addition of Isordil and Captopril back to his chronic medical program , the patient 's right atrial pressure was 6 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 9 and the cardiac index was 2.7 .\\nSystemic vascular resistance was 900 .\\nThe patient was then decannulated and sent to the floor with improvement in his central hemodynamics .\\nOver the subsequent days of his hospitalization , the patient had adjustment of his diuretic program .\\nAt discharge his goal weight will be 120 pounds and he will be maintained on a chronic Dobutamine infusion at 250 mcg. per minute .\\nShould he tachy phylax to this which is inevitable , he will be begun on a home Milrinone infusion per previous protocol .\\nThe patient on the dose of Dobutamine noted , had little in the way of resting symptoms and was without paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and orthopnea and able to ambulate approximately 100-150 feet without dyspnea .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nLasix 20 mg. q.day .\\nIsordil 10 mg. t.i.d.

.\\nIn the past , he has not been known to have a history of CNS metastases .\\nThe episode of potential seizure activity occurred in the setting of a bowel movement and may have been associated with vasovagal activity .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nThe past medical history is as above .\\nFAMILY HISTORY :\\nNoncontributory .\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS :\\nThe review of systems is negative , except as above .\\nALLERGIES :\\nThe patient has no known drug allergies .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nThe physical examination reveals a pleasant 70 year old male in no acute distress .\\nThe blood pressure

AM\\nDischarge Summary\\nUnsigned\\nDIS\\nReport Status :\\nUnsigned\\nADMISSION DATE :\\n8-15-93\\nDISCHARGE DATE :\\n9-19-93\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient is a 78 year old male with dysphagia who was found to have endoscopically two nodules in the esophagus , biopsy of which showed small cell carcinoma .\\nRecently , he has complained of pain radiating down the left leg and work up had shown absent left knee jerk .\\nPlain films of the lumbosacral spine showed some scoliosis with blastic changes around L3 .\\nThe bone marrow biopsy was positive for metastatic carcinoma .\\nThe patient was admitted for further evaluation .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination on admission , the blood pressure was 164/90 , pulse 88 , respirations 20 .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nNote :\\npast medical history included hypertension , treated by Cardizem .\\nThe patient also has a history of degenerative joint disease .\\nHe had an episode of chest pain but ruled out for myocardial infarction .\\nOn physical examination , vital signs were as above .\\nThe head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was within normal limits , neck was supple , lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion .\\nThe abdomen was benign with no masses felt .\\nCardiovascular exam :\\ngrade I / VI systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border , single S1 , S2 .\\nThe rectal examination showed guaiac negative stool .\\nExtremities :\\nwithin normal limits .\\nThe neurological examination showed an absent left knee jerk .\\nCerebellar function was normal .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nsignificant for a sodium of 140 , potassium 3.9 , chloride 105 , BUN and creatinine 21 and 1.5 , LDH 732 , SGOT 84 , alkaline phosphatase 145 , bilirubin 0.3 , calcium 10 , albumen 4.1 , globulin 3.9 , white blood count 8.9 , hematocrit 43.3 , 62 polys , 26 lymphs , 9 monos , 1 eo , 2 basos , prothrombin time 9.8/10.0 , partial thromboplastin time 31.8 .\\nDuring this admission , an upper gastrointestinal and small bowel follow-through on 9-5-93 was normal .\\nA computerized tomography scan of the chest showed diffuse esophageal wall thickening , dilatation of the esophagus with air fluid levels and no evidence of mediastinitis and some air space disease in a medial segment of the right middle lobe .\\nBone scan showed multiple regions of abnormally increased activity in the dorsal spine and lumbar vertebrae , as well as a right anterior fourth rib , consistent with metastases .\\nA magnetic resonance imaging study of the brain showed no definite evidence of metastatic deposits .\\nThere was microvascular disease .\\nA computerized tomography scan of the abdomen showed multiple low density lesions within the liver , consistent with metastatic disease and a 1.5 centimeter low thoracic paraesophageal lymph node , pathological .\\nSpleen , pancreas and kidneys were within normal limits .\\nA magnetic resonance imaging study of the brain showed no metastases .\\nThe magnetic resonance imaging study of the spine showed extensive bony metastases .\\nThere was no evidence of spinal cord compression on magnetic resonance imaging study , though there was evidence of pressure on the L4 nerve root .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted and he was started on chemotherapy and radiation therapy to the L4 spine region .\\nThe first course of chemotherapy was given from 8-19-93 through 8-21-93 .\\nThis was VP-16 150 mg daily x three and cisplatin 60 mg daily x three with Zofran 11 mg on three occasions as an antiemetic and each dose of cisplatin was preceded by 12.5 grams of Decadron .\\nThe chemotherapy was well tolerated but did result in febrile neutropenia .\\nGranulocyte colony stimulating factor was added .\\nThus white blood count dropped to 0.6 minimum on 8-27 , with platelet count of 63,000 but with granulocyte colony stimulating factor support and antibiotics for febrile neutropenia , white blood count recovered .\\nActually the lowest white blood count was 0.5 on 8-31-93 .\\nOn that occasion , platelet count was as low as 17,000 .\\nBy 9-8-93 , the white blood count was back up to 16.2 .\\nThe patient 's course was complicated by severe pain and intractable nausea and vomiting and severe substernal pain .\\nHe is on MS Contin and also on Duragesic patch .\\nHe continued to have nausea and vomiting .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by Dr. Signs of Gastroenterology .\\nEventually , a PICC line was inserted and he was given central total parenteral nutrition because of severe anorexia during radiation therapy .\\nTwo weeks passed without a bowel movement because of the lack of intake and eventually that resolved .\\nIt was felt that endoscopy would be of value .\\nA central venous line was placed on 8-29-93 .\\nAfter neutropenia resolved by 9-2-93 with white blood count rising to 2.2 and platelet count to 28,000 , endoscopy became feasible .\\nThis was done on 9-4-93 and there were inflammatory exudates , ulcerations , and granulation tissue in the middle and distal third of the esophagus , but the tumor polypoid masses had completely disappeared .\\nCytologic brushings of the ulcerated areas were positive for cancer cells but deep biopsies were negative .\\nThe patient was treated with fluconazole in case there was any Monilia , although biopsy did not confirm the presence of Monilia .\\nGradually during the hospitalization , the sternal pain improved , as did the pain in the left hip and the patient became able to ambulate somewhat .\\nHe was making progress and accordingly , a second course of chemotherapy was given at lower dose .\\nHe received VP-16 100 mg daily x three , 9-12 , 9-13 and 9-14-93 , and cisplatin 40 mg daily x three on that same date with Zofran 10 mg.\\nThe only problem was some recurrent nausea .\\nThe radiation therapy was finally finished on the day of discharge , 9-19-93 , at which point the patient was able to take fluids and food but was still occasionally vomiting .\\nHis white blood count was in the range of 53,000 because Neupogen had been started with his second cycle of chemotherapy and will be continued until it is clear that he has passed the nadir of any neutropenia to be expected from this cycle of chemotherapy .\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :\\n1. metastatic small cell cancer of esophageal origin to liver and bone ,\\n2. severe ulcerations of the esophagus at sites of prior tumor ,\\n3. intractable nausea and vomiting ,\\n4. pain syndrome , largely resolved ,\\n5. hypertension .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nPrilosec 20 mg PO qa.m. , Senokot one to two tablets PO q.day as needed , Colace 100 mg PO b.i.d. , Microstatin 100,000 units swish and swallow four times a day , Darvocet-N 100 1 PO q4h prn pain , Cardizem 240 mg PO q.day , Neupogen 300 mg subcutaneously q.day x ten days , depending on trend of blood counts , Compazine 10 mg PO q6h prn nausea , PICC

the scan was aborted and he was taken directly to the operating room at 03:00 .\\nAt laparotomy , there was a liter of blood in the peritoneal cavity .\\nThere was a class II laceration of the left liver at the falciform ligament which was actively bleeding , a tear of the transverse mesocolon from its base to the bowel wall with active bleeding , a 7 cm serosal tear of the adjacent transverse colon , and a large central retroperitoneal hematoma .\\nControl of the super-celiac aorta was obtained , and both left and right sided \" Mattox \" maneuvers were performed .\\nThe retroperitoneum was opened , with vigorous bleeding resulting .\\nThis was controlled , necessitating ten minutes of aortic clamping and found to have originated from the rupture of the left renal vein one centimeter from its junction with the inferior vena cava .\\nThe vein was divided and suture ligated .\\nBleeding from the liver was controlled with sutures .\\nThe tears in the transverse mesocolon and colon serosa were repaired .\\nThe examination of the remainder of the abdominal contents revealed no other injury ; in particular , the entire anterior surface and the immediately juxtaduodenal posterior surface of the pancreas were normal .\\nThe patient was now very stable , and he was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nThe patient had received ten units of packed red blood cells , five units of fresh frozen plasma , seven units of platelets , and nine liters of Ringer \\'s lactate .\\nAn intracranial pressure monitoring bolt had been placed by the Neurosurgery Service staff during the laparotomy .\\nIntracranial pressures were normal .\\nThat day , cranial computerized tomography scan and cervical spine films were normal .\\nAn arch aortogram was normal .\\nOver the ensuing twenty-four hours , bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray with poor oxygenation and labile blood pressure requiring PA line guided fluid and pressors developed .\\nThe patient had a large fluid requirement with total body capillary leak , decreasing SVR , oliguria unresponsive to Lasix / Mannitol accompanied by a rise in creatinine to 3.2 , worsening ARDS , a rise in temperature to 103 , and a serum amylase of 1265 .\\nHe was returned to the operating room on July 4 .\\nThree liters of clear green fluid were found in the abdominal cavity .\\nExploration of the pancreas revealed a posterior fracture a the superior mesenteric vessels .\\nBecause of the intense diffuse inflammatory reaction that had already set in , it was decided that neither distal pancreatic resection nor Roux-en-Y drainage was feasible .\\nFour large flat Jackson-Pratt drains were placed , and gastrostomy , jejunostomy , and cholecystostomy tubes , as well as a right subclavian Quinton catheter were placed .\\nThe patient \\'s hemodynamics had improved markedly with the evacuation of the peritoneal pancreatic fluid , so that he was no longer on pressors .\\nHowever , upon transfer from the operating room table to the RICU bed , he suffered a cardiac arrest , which upon investigation was a primary respiratory arrest ; the initial arterial blood gas was 32/88/6.92 .\\nHe was successfully resuscitated after fifteen minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and he was taken to the RICU .\\nContinuous venovenous hemodialysis was started on July 5 , and continued for most of the remainder of the patient \\'s course .\\nVancomycin , Flagyl , and Aztreonam were given for gram negative Coccobacilli ( later identified as Bacteroides ) that had grown in his blood cultures and gram negative rods ( Enterobacter ) in his peritoneal fluid .\\nHe was kept sedated and paralyzed because of his severe adult respiratory distress syndrome .\\nTotal parenteral nutrition was started on July 5 .\\nInitial improvement was followed by recurrence of low SVR , high cardiac output , ongoing acidosis , requiring norepinephrine infusion in the 30 to 40 mcg per minute range ; drainage from the Jackson-Pratt drains were minimal despite irrigation and manipulation .\\nThe patient was returned to the operating room on July 10 , where several loculated thin fluid collections were drained and obviously necrotic tissue was debrided .\\nIt was decided to place more drains and pack the lesser sac with Adaptic and laparotomy pads .\\nThe abdomen was left open , with the wound margins connected by a sheet of Marlex mesh to prevent evisceration .\\nHe was returned to the operating room on July 12 , 13 , 16 , 19 , 21 , and 23 for packing change , irrigation and debridement .\\nTracheostomy was also performed on July 17 .\\nThere was severe diffuse peritonitis with intense inflammation , infection , and patchy necrosis of peritoneal surfaces and of the distal pancreas .\\nThe subsequent overall course was a slow downhill one , with ongoing extreme hyperdynamic ( cardiac output 12 to 15 liters per minute ) and catabolic state .\\nOn July 26 , abdominal irrigation and debridement was performed in the RICU ; this was repeated daily for the next three days .\\nOn July 29 , the septic state with low SVR and acidosis accelerated beyond the control of maximal support .\\nHis blood pressure gradually fell , and he died early on July 30 , 1993 .\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :\\nSevere blunt abdominal trauma with rupture of liver , left renal vein , pancreas , and transverse mesocolon .\\nSPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :\\n1. 7-2-93 , emergency room exploratory laparotomy , repair of liver laceration , repair of torn transverse mesocolon , repair of serosal tear of transverse colon , ligation and division of ruptured left renal vein , exploration of pancreas ,\\n2. 7-4-93 , exploratory laparotomy , irrigation and debridement , pancreatic drainage placement , gastrostomy tube , jejunostomy , cholecystostomy , placement of right subclavian Quinton catheter ,\\n3. 7-10-93 , abdominal irrigation and debridement and packing of pancreas ,\\n4. 7-12-93 , 7-14 , 7-20 , 7-22 , and 7-24 , were the same as 7-10-93 , and 7-17 was the same with the addition of tracheostomy were same as 7-10 ,\\nCOMPLICATIONS :\\nSevere necrotizing pancreatitis and diffuse peritonitis .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nN / A.\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nN / A.\\nESTIMATED DISABILITY AND PROBABLE DURATION :\\nN / A.\\nDISPOSITION :\\nMason Street .\\nRISSPA BREATH , M.D.\\nTR :\\nun / bmot\\nDD :\\n08-07-93\\nTD :\\n08/08/93\\nCC :\\n[ report_end ]\\n</TEXT>', \"<TEXT>\\n086513773\\nFIH\\n5078706\\n58262/gv5v\\n008122\\nMartin Luther King Day 12:00:00 AM\\nDischarge Summary\\nUnsigned\\nDIS\\nReport Status :\\nUnsigned\\nADMISSION DATE :\\nMartin Luther King Day\\nDISCHARGE DATE :\\n01/22/93\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nMr. Louplardkote is a 70 year old male who was admitted for coronary artery bypass grafting .\\nHe has been followed by his local physician for heart block which has progressed and culminated in a DDD pacer being inserted 02/92 .\\nIn March , 1993 he noted chest discomfort with exertion .\\nAn exercise tolerance test and stress Thallium showed septal and anterior wall ischemia .\\nIn October , 1993 the patient developed shortness of breath and orthopnea .\\nAn echocardiogram at the time revealed left ventricular dilatation and septal dyskinesis .\\nThe patient subsequently developed congestive heart failure which was treated with diuretics .\\nOn 12/29 the patient underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed a right coronary artery that had serial stenosis , and left anterior descending artery that had a long complex proximal lesion and a circumflex which had its first obtuse marginal which was stenotic .\\nThe left ventriculogram showed global hypokinesis and preserved left ventricular function with mitral valve prolapse without regurgitation .\\nThe patient is thus admitted for coronary artery bypass grafting .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1 ) hypercholesterolemia ,\\n2 ) arthritis ,\\n3 ) history of guaiac-positive stools with a lower gastrointestinal endoscopy negative three years ago ,\\n4 ) status post appendectomy .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nToprol XL 50 mg. po q.day , Ismo 20 mg. po bid , Lasix 40 mg. d , Lopid 600 mg. po bid , Questran 1 scoop po bid , nitroglycerin spray prn .\\nALLERGIES :\\nno known drug allergies .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nHis head , eyes , ears , nose , and throat exam was benign .\\nCardiac exam revealed a normal S1 and S2 with a I-II / VI late systolic murmur radiating to the apex .\\nLungs were clear .\\nAbdomen was benign .\\nRectal :\\nguaiac negative , no lesions , smooth prostate .\\nVascular exam ; 2+ pulses throughout bilaterally without bruits .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nOn admission , chest x-ray revealed two nodular opacities that were projected over the left lung , one over the anterior aspect of the left fourth rib and the other over the interspace between the anterior sixth and seventh ribs .\\nThese were also seen on previous film .\\nThese were felt to be consistent with a granulomata .\\nThere was also a bipolar pacemaker present .\\nCreatinine was 0.9 , BUN 13 , hematocrit was 40 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to the hospital on 01/15/93 and on the following day was taken to the operating room where he underwent a saphenous coronary artery bypass graft to the diagonal , circumflex marginal artery , and acute marginal coronary artery and left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending coronary artery .\\nThis operation was performed by Dr. Chitllik Kote .\\nIntraoperative findings were as follows :\\nThe pericardium was opened to reveal a heart that appeared essentially normal .\\nThe diagonal coronary artery was isolated , opened and probed with a 1.5 millimeter probe .\\nThe circumflex marginal artery was small and only took a 1 millimeter probe tightly .\\nThe first main was anastomosed side to side to the diagonal and end to end to the circumflex marginal artery .\\nThe left anterior descending artery was then isolated , opened , probed with a 1.5 millimeter probe and anastomosed to the left internal mammary artery .\\nThe acute marginal branch of the right coronary artery was isolated , opened and probed with a 1.5 millimeter probe tightly and a second main was anastomosed to this .\\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well and was transported to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition on nitroglycerin at 50 mcg. per minute Levophed at 4 mcg. per minute and Lidocaine at 1 mg. r minute .\\nThe patient was extubated on postoperative day # 1 and transported to the routine postoperative care floor on postoperative day # 2 in good condition .\\nThe only issue of note during the patient 's SICU course was a small right apical pneumothorax which disappeared on repeat chest x-ray .\\nThe other issue was that the Pacer Lab was consulted for an atrial sensing problem .\\nThe pace setter 2022 Synchrony II was interrogated .\\nIt was found to have inadequate atrial sensing , even post re-programming to the maximum sensitivity at 0.5 millivolts .\\nNo changes with unipolar ring or tip .\\nThe V threshhold was changed from 0.6 millivolts/ 2.0 millivolts to 0.8 millivolts/ 4.0 millivolts .\\nThe V sensor was changed from 4 millivolts to 2 millivolts .\\nIt was felt that the atrial pacing would improve as the edema resolved .\\nMeanwhile , the patient was AV paced using the epicardial wires .\\nWhile on the routine postoperative care floor the patient continued to progress well .\\nOf note , he developed a small right apical pneumothorax which was followed on serial films and found to be stable and was not causing the patient any respiratory distress .\\nAlso , the Pacer Service re-programmed the patient 's cardiac pacer to a VVIR mode with a rate of 60 beats per minute , an AV delay of 175 , a maximum track of 120 .\\nThe ventricular pulse configuration was bipolar with a V-pulse width of .8 , a V-pulse amplitude of 4.0 , a V-sense configuration of bipolar , a V-sensitivity of 2.0 and a V-refractory of 250 .\\nThe atrial pulse configuration was bipolar with an A-pulse width of .4 , an A-pulse amplitude of 2.5 , an A-sensed configuration that was bipolar , an A-sensitivity that was .5 , an A-refractory that was 325 .\\nBlanking was set at 38 , AV-safety option was on enable , PVC options were on , PMT options were off , a rate respiratory AV-delay was on enable , a magnet was temporary off .\\nThe threshhold was 2.0 .\\nThe measured average sensor was 2.0 .\\nThe slope was 8 .\\nThe maximum sensory rate was 110 .\\nThe reaction time was fast , the recovery time was medium .\\nThe patient continued to progress well and was ultimately discharged on 01/22/93 in good condition .\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :\\nCoronary artery disease .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nSaphenous coronary artery bypass graft to the diagonal , circumflex marginal artery and acute marginal coronary artery and left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending artery on 01/17/93 by Dr. Chitllik Kote .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nGood .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nLasix 40 mg. po q.day , Ecotrin 325 mg. po q.day , Iron 325 mg. po tid , Folate 1 mg. po q.day , Lopid 600 mg. po bid , Questran 1 scoop bid .\\nDISPOSITION :\\nThe patient was discharged to home .\\nHe will followup with Dr. Chitllik Kote , Cardiothoracic Surgery ;

apical pneumothorax without interval change .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nEarly in through her hospitalization her electrocardiograms remained unchanged and she ruled out for myocardial infarction by enzymes .\\nHer oxygen saturations remained 88-93 percent on four liters of nasal prong oxygen .\\nUpon review of her computerized tomography scan there was demonstration of progressive collapse of her left lower lobe with a mass like effect adjacent to the atelectasis .\\nThere were two large mediastinal nodes and needle biopsy of the left lobe lesion was non-diagnostic .\\nShe was referred for tissue diagnosis and on 1/13/94 was brought to the operating room .\\nShe underwent flexible bronchoscopy with mediastinoscopy .\\nThese were negative for tumor and a mini left thoracotomy was performed with pleural biopsy .\\nIntraoperatively there was a large emphysematous portion of the left lung which prohibited her left lower lobe to fully expand .\\nIt was decided to perform reduction pneumoplasty .\\nThis proceeded uneventfully .\\nShe was extubated and stable with a good airway and good oxygen saturation .\\nHowever , upon transferring her from the operating room bed to the stretcher she had an arrest .\\nThis appeared to be respiratory in origin .\\nShe was placed back on the operating room table and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was begun .\\nPressors were given and she quickly responded with a return in blood pressure and heart rate .\\nHer blood pressure remained unstable requiring large amounts of pressors .\\nX-rays showed no pneumothorax and there was no bleeding from her chest tubes .\\nShe was therefore transferred up to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nEarly in her postoperative course her pulmonary artery pressures were quite high , 70/30 .\\nHer wedge pressure was 20 and there were no electrocardiogram changes .\\nShe ruled out for myocardial infarction .\\nShe developed a picture consistent with right heart failure with pulmonary hypertension and require nitric oxide administration .\\nThis improved her right heart function with lower PA pressures .\\nShe developed a right pleural effusion which required chest tube placement to remove 1200 ccs of straw-colored fluid .\\nShe remained fully ventilated with marginal hemodynamic status on Levophed , dobutamine and nitric oxide .\\nUltimately she was able to be weaned off of her Levophed as well as her nitric oxide .\\nHowever , because of persistent episodes of right heart failure , dobutamine was started .\\nThis improved her cardiac function .\\nShe failed to wean from the ventilator and on 2/14/94 was brought to the operating room for a tracheostomy .\\nShe had a complicated course from an Infectious Disease standpoint with multiple positive cultures including sputum positive for Pseudomonas cepacia , blood cultures which were positive for Streptococcus milleri .\\nThe right pleural fluid was also positive for Streptococcus milleri .\\nShe had Citrobacter from her sinuses with evidence of sinusitis .\\nShe was treated with multiple courses of broad spectrum antibiotics .\\nGiven her protracted postoperative course the family uniformly decided to

:\\nThis is a 56-year-old man with a history of ischemic disease transferred to the FIH for further care for cardiogenic shock .\\nMr. Given had an anterior myocardial infarction in 1981 .\\nHe had inferior myocardial infarction in February 1992 .\\nHis course was complicated at that time by hypertension and an echocardiogram showed an LV ejection fraction of 0.10 to 0.15 .\\nIn August , 1993 he had an out of hospital cardiac arrest .\\nHe rule in for another myocardial infarction at that time .\\nHe was transferred to the FIH where he underwent a work up of both his arrhythmia and his heart failure .\\nAn automatic implantable defibrillator was placed .\\nHe was thought to be a good candidate for a transplant at that time as coronary arteriography showed diffuse disease in the LAD and right coronary arteries as well as a proximal circumflex stenosis .\\nBecause of the diffuse nature of the disease and the left ventricular dysfunction , Mr. Given was thought not to be a revascularization candidate and was listed for a transplant .\\nMr. Given waited as an outpatient for the availability of a donor heart .\\nHe was admitted to the hospital in late April with multiple episodes of bloody diarrhea .\\nColonoscopy demonstrated severe Crohn 's disease with sparing of the rectum .\\nA perirectal fistula was seen .\\nTreatment with IV corticosteroids led to improvement and Mr. Given was discharged from the hospital ten days ago .\\nOn the evening of April 22nd , Mr. Given developed progressively worsening dyspnea .\\nHe presented to the Iming Medical Center emergency room on the morning of April 22nd with hypertension and dyspnea .\\nHe was given intravenous fluid to support his blood pressure and developed pulmonary edema and was intubated .\\nHypertension continued and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed .\\nHe is now being transferred to the FIH for further treatment .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nPhysical examination on transfer was remarkable for a blood pressure of 80/56 and a heart rate of 124 .\\nHis CVP was 16 .\\nHe was on the balloon pump at the time .\\nHis chest was clear anteriorly .\\nHis cardiac exam was remarkable for a summation gallop .\\nNo murmur was auscultated but the high heart rate did diminish the possibility of this .\\nHis abdomen was soft and he had no extremity edema .\\nHis feet were cool but there were pedal pulses bilaterally .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nAdmission laboratory studies included a hematocrit of 34.3 and a white count of 25,700 .\\nThe sodium was 126 , the BUN 80 and a creatinine of 4.6 .\\nElectrocardiogram revealed a sinus tachycardia with an intraventricular conduction defect .\\nThere were inferior Q waves consistent with an old infarct .\\nThe chest x-ray revealed mild pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nMr. Given was admitted to the hospital and it was hoped that his end organ dysfunction would improve with a period of ballooning and improved perfusion such as to allow transplantation to eventually take place .\\nHe was maintained on Levophed as a vasopressor as well as dopamine and dobutamine .\\nIt was noted that his intra-aortic balloon pump was only a 30 ml pump , and on the day after admission , Mr. Given was taken to the catheterization laboratory where this was exchanged for a 40 ml pump .\\nAfter replacement of the intra-aortic balloon pump , Mr. Given remained critically ill , although there was some improvement in his augmented diastolic pressure .\\nHe did develop atrial fibrillation , however , which led to hemodynamic decompensation with a wedge pressure of 32 and a cardiac index of 1.6 .\\nIt was hoped that with continued inotropic support this would improve .\\nHe also remained intubated .\\nMr. Given was seen by Dr. Farstshuff of the GI Service for advice regarding his Crohn 's disease .\\nAll of these issues , including his acute renal failure , were thought to be contraindications to transplantation .\\nAs Mr. Given did not have any bowel sounds , he did have to remain on nasogastric suction .\\nHe was seen in consultation by Dr. Needs of the Renal Unit .\\nDr. Needs felt that the patient had had ischemic acute tubular necrosis and that we could continue to administer diuretics in a an effort to take off volume , but that we did have to allow time to pass in order to see improvement .\\nProcainamide was begun in an effort to convert Mr. Given to sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation .\\nInitially he was in and out of sinus rhythm , but paroxysmal atrial fibrillation did occur frequently .\\nAs Mr. Given 's renal function did not improve , he was begun on continuous venovenous hemodialysis .\\nThis resulted in a reasonable clearance of creatinine .\\nHe was able to get some fluid off as well .\\nWith getting some volume off , the patient 's ventilation improved , as did many of his other metabolic parameters .\\nHis cardiac index had also improved with this to 2.7 , although he was on dobutamine as well .\\nOn 6/19 an effort was made to attempt to wean the intra-aortic balloon pump .\\nWith a decrease in the counterpulsation ration , he developed atrial flutter with a fall in blood pressure and cardiac index .\\nThe balloon pump was restored .\\nHe was continued on this as well as on dobutamine and amrinone support .\\nHe continued on hemodialysis , but had little urine output .\\nSupportive care continued .\\nUnfortunately , the white blood count began rising , raising the possibility of sepsis .\\nBroad spectrum antibiotics to cover potential sources in the gastrointestinal tract were begun and ciprofloxacin was added .\\nMr. Given 's blood pressure appeared to stabilize .\\nAnother effort was made on 6/22 to attempt to wean the balloon , but this led to an increase in his wedge pressure and a fall in his arterial pressure , and this was stopped and he was restored to full counterpulsation .\\nHe had been able to be transiently extubated after dialysis had reduced his lung water , but he had to be reintubated on 6/24 .\\nHemodialysis continued with maintenance of reasonable metabolic parameters .\\nHe did develop worsening metabolic acidosis .\\nHis hemodialysis was adjusted in an effort to resolve this .\\nHe continued on vancomycin , ciprofloxacin , Zosyn , and fluconazole antibiotics .\\nAnother effort was made to attempt to wean the intra-aortic balloon pump on 6/26 .\\nThis resulted in a fall in his cardiac index , but his blood pressure and wedge pressure were stable .\\nHe did have runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia .\\nOn 6/29 Mr. Given began developing periods of hypotension .\\nThe patient stated that he did not want to be reintubated , as it became quite clear that he would not be a transplant candidate .\\nHe began having multiple runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia .\\nThe patient and his significant friend , Incloztaua , had a long discussion with his physicians and they felt that , given the futility of his situation , supportive care should be ended .\\nIndicative of this , Mr. Given took his oxygen mask and demanded that it not be replaced .\\nHe developed progressive hypotension and was pronounced dead early on the morning of 7/1 .\\nCAGHALA R.

chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .\\nShe did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .\\nThis may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .\\nBronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .\\nShe underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .\\nShe had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .\\nA bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper

right subclavian .\\nThe patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\\nFindings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .\\nEsophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .\\nShe remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nThe patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\\nOn postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by the

multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .\\nThe patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .\\nA repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .\\nA pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .\\nShe remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .\\nHer chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .\\nShe suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .\\nHer steroids were weaned .\\nBecause of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on

amikacin and imipenem .\\nShe developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .\\nOn March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .\\nShe was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .\\nOn March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .\\nAttempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .\\nThis was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .\\nShe continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .\\nShe also fell into a coma once again .\\nOn March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .\\nOn April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .\\nDiscussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .\\nShe had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .\\nDecision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .\\nThe patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .\\nHer respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .\\nDISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe family

Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , diagnosed in May 1998 .\\n2. Hypothyroidism , diagnosed twenty five years ago , but untreated for the past several years .\\n3. Iron deficiency anemia .\\n4. Candidiasis of the groin , tinea pedis .\\n5. Diagnosis of nodular density on chest x-ray .\\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY :\\nHemorrhoidectomy .\\nWound debridement , as above .\\nALLERGIES :\\nNo known drug allergies .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nSynthroid 0.125 milligrams po q day .\\nDiabeta 7.5 milligrams po q day .\\nIron sulfate 325 milligrams PO t.i.d.

Neurological :\\nOn admission the patient was intubated and sedated .\\nHer sedation was gradually weaned during her first month in the Intensive Care Unit and she was noted to have an underlying depression and history of obsessive compulsive disorder as listed from the patient and her family .\\nA psychiatric evaluation was obtained and she was placed on Paxil at 5 milligrams which was gradually increased to a total of 20 milligrams po q day at the time of her admission .\\nOn August 29th , Ms. Abreun again required sedation when she found apneic and hypotensive .\\nShe spent several days in the Intensive Care Unit at that time , during which her sedation was gradually weaned back to off .\\n2. Pulmonary :\\nMs. Abreun was admitted , sedated and on a respirator , requiring minimal settings with a pressure support of 10 and a pep of 5 .\\nAfter two weeks of intubation on July 25th the patient went to the operating room for a tracheostomy which she tolerated without issue .\\nOver the next several weeks , the ventilatory support was gradually weaned to off .\\nBy August 9th she was tolerating trach mask trials and was on the verge of tracheostomy removal by August 29th .\\nAt this time , she had a sudden episode of respiratory distress accompanied by hypotension and unresponsiveness .\\nShe was bag masked and taken immediately to the Intensive Care Unit where she was placed on respiratory support with SIMV settings which were gradually weaned over the course of her ten days in the Intensive Care Unit .\\nAfter her wean from the respiratory , she was transferred back to the floor and over the next several days tolerated trach mask trials admirably and had her tracheostomy removed on September 16th , 1998 .\\nAt the time of her discharge , she had no acute respiratory issues .\\n3. Cardiovascular :\\nMs. Abreun was admitted on cardiac support requiring 30 of Neo-Synephrine .\\nShe was placed on a Swan Gans catheter monitor and gradually weaned off the Neo-Synephrine by the 22nd of July .\\nShe required no further support and had no further issues until August 29th when she had her respiratory crisis and was transferred to the unit .\\nAt this time her dramatic pressure drop required Dopamine support at levels of 500 micrograms per minute .\\nA Swan Gans catheter floated at this time demonstrated an SVR of 500 .\\nShe was supported with Dopamine and with fluid and was slow to come off the Dopamine requiring approximately 8 to 10 days for full weaning .\\nAfter the wean she required no further cardiac medication and had no further issues .\\n4. Renal :\\nMs. Abreun 's fluid management was an important contributor to her hospital course .\\nShe presented with massive ascites and anasarca for which she received large volume diuresis with regular Lasix dosing daily .\\nRenal parameters were normal until the time of her respiratory cardiovascular crisis on August 29th .\\nAt this time , it was noted that her bun jumped to levels of approximately 80 , while her creatinine stayed at levels of .6 to .7 .\\nAn elevation by Dr. Freiermthalskush of renal medicine at first suspected a subclinical congestive heart failure as being responsible for a prerenal azotemia , however on further elucidation of the patient 's course , it is evident that a broad sepsis caused by her pneumonia was responsible for her decreased SVR and eventual renal hypoperfusion .\\nHer azotemia responded readily to pressor support and fluid resuscitation .\\nAt the end of her second Intensive Care Unit admission , her bun and creatinine had resolved to normal values .\\n5. Gastrointestinal :\\nMs. Abreun was admitted nothing by mouth , intubated on intravenous fluids alone .\\nShe was immediately begun on total parenteral nutrition therapy for what would be a prolonged course without PO intake .\\nOn July 25th a G tube was placed and feeds were begun gradually .\\nThese G tube feeds were gradually increased with a total parenteral nutrition wean , however at the time of her re-admission to the Intensive Care Unit on August 29th aspiration was suspected and all tube feeds were held .\\nShe was maintained on total parenteral nutrition for the course of her time in the Intensive Care Unit .\\nAt the end of this time , she was begun gradually on G tube feeding , however she was able to tolerate only very small volumes and produce large aspirates .\\nThis problem had remained and been ongoing for the remainder of her hospital at Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .\\nShe is currently being supported on tube feeds of Vivonex at a rate of approximately 20 and hour with aspirates being measured q 4 hours and measuring from 30 to 250 regularly .\\nShe has also been supplemented with Glutamine 10 grams b.i.d. via the G tube in hopes of reviving what most certainly be her gut atrophy from prolonged disuse .\\nMs. Abreun , from the onset of her stay at Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital demonstrated elevated alkaline phosphatase levels in isolation from her other liver function tests .\\nThese values ranging as high as 2300 were evaluated by gastrointestinal consult who came and performed and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography which demonstrated a normal biliary system with diameters on the large end of normal .\\nStone was demonstrated in the gallbladder , but there was no evidence of obstruction and the study was ready as normal .\\n5 'nucleotidase values have also been elevated ranging from 150 to 180 .\\nTo date there has been no satisfactory explanation for these elevations in alkaline phosphatase and 5 'nucleotidase and all associated studies have been negative .\\nFurther evaluation of this during her later hospital stay or as an outpatient .\\n6. Infectious disease :\\nMs. Abreun underwent a work up for tuberculosis at the beginning of her hospital course .\\nShe ruled out by PPD .\\nThe initial management of her necrotizing fascitis was empiric with Imipenem , Flagyl and Vancomycin .\\nBecause of the extent of her wound , she was also treated with hyperbaric oxygen which was of some benefit in resolving her infection .\\nThe course of Flagyl , Imipenem and Vancomycin was continued for fourteen days .\\nAt this time Imipenem were discontinued and Vancomycin was maintained alone for additional several days .\\nShe then went without antibiotic therapy for a period of several weeks until her crisis of August 29th .\\nON admission to the unit , she was begun on triple antibiotic therapy with Levo / Vanc/Flagyl .\\nShortly thereafter Gentamicin was added to the regimen which was maintained for a period of one week until cultures came back and her therapy could be stream lined to Vancomycin , Levofloxacin alone .\\nAfter a ten day course of Levofloxacin it was discontinued , Vancomycin was maintained for five additional days , after which time , it was discontinued as well and she was without antibiotics .\\nOn discharge , she was currently taking no antibiotics .\\nMs. Abreun entered the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital having taking only oral hypoglycemic agents for control of her diabetes .\\nBecause of the stress of her infection and Intensive Care Unit admission she was requiring sliding scale Insulin for the full course of her hospital stay .\\nHer total parenteral nutrition was also supplemented with Insulin NPH for better control .\\nHer total parenteral nutrition is currently supplemented with 30 units NPH q day and she is on a sliding scale to control the remainder of her sugars .\\nMs. Abreun 's hypothyroidism diagnosed shortly before her admission was an important aspect of her therapy during her course at Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .\\nHer thyroid necessity was poorly controlled with a Synthroid dose of 0.125 milligrams for the majority of her stay .\\nAt the time of her admission to the Intensive Care Unit on August 29th it was noted that she had a thyroid stimulating hormone that was dramatically raised to a value of 26.83 .\\nMore active supplementation was performed increasing her dose to .3 milligrams q day , which caused a rapid resolution of her thyroid studies and an improvement in her physiology almost immediately .\\nShe has since been maintained on a dose of 0.2 milligrams IV q d .\\nHowever , she has had a gradual rise in her thyroid stimulating hormone to a value of 6.68 .\\nHer discharge medication will include Synthroid dose of 0.3 milligrams po q day with recommendation that this parameter be followed closely .\\nIN SUMMARY :\\nMs. Abreun is a fifty nine-year-old female who presented with necrotizing fascitis of the right hip , status post debridement , severely debilitated by the extent of her infection .\\nOver the course of 2 months this infection was cleared , the wound was cleaned and split thickness skin grafting was successful in covering over the wound .\\nHer course , however was complicated by an methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia which was resistant to therapy and which produced a profound sepsis which caused a hypotensive ana apneic episode which required Intensive Care Unit support for a period of a week .\\nHer course was also complicated by her hypoactive thyroid function which went unrecognized for some period , but has since resolved with aggressive Synthroid therapy .\\nCurrently , her most issues are the advancement of her tube feeds and the restarting of her PO intake which was planned to begin for the next several days before her transfer was initiated .\\nHer wound also requires further care as smaller areas of non-take in the graft are being management with sterile saline wet to dry dressings .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable with issues resolving .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nHeparin 5,000 units sub q b.i.d.\\nPrilosec 20 milligrams per G tube q day .\\nPaxil 10 milligrams per G tube q.h.s.\\nMilk of Magnesia 30 ccs per G tube q.h.s.\\nLotrimin cream b.i.d. to effected areas .\\nNystatin powder b.i.d. to effected areas .\\nLasix 20 milligrams intravenous q day .\\nSynthroid 0.3 milligrams per G tube q day .\\nReglan 10 milligrams per G tube t.i.d.\\nPeri-Colace 15 ccs per G tube q.h.s.\\nGlutamine 10 grams diluted as necessary per G tube t.i.d.\\nAtivan 0.5 milligrams to 1 milligrams per G tube or sublingual q 6 hours whenever necessary .\\nInsulin sliding scale as follows ;

cellulitis , orbital hemorrhage , protein calorie malnutrition , gastrointestinal hemorrhage , pulmonary hemorrhage / pneumonia , hyperglycemia , renal insufficiency , hyperuricemia , hypophosphatemia .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old male had been noted to be anemic with an abnormal white blood count since at least November 1993 , while he was living in Aersing Rocuch Sun and his physicians there had begun to manage him with transfusions , and low dose hydroxyurea .\\nApparently , a bone marrow biopsy at the time confirmed the diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia .\\nHe came to this country in late December 1994 to live with his son for a few months and was referred to me for follow up .\\nHe had been noting night sweats , increasing fatigue , anorexia , and dyspnea , which were not particularly improved by increased transfusions or alterations of hydroxy urea .\\nHe became profoundly thrombocytopenic , and ultimately was admitted to the hospital on 2/15 with headache and weakness .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nSignificant for chronic atrial fibrillation , managed with an Italian variation of Digoxin , and Amioadrone , hypertension managed with an ACE inhibitor , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease managed with a zanthine preparation and low dose steroids , as well as an occasional inhaler .\\nOther medical problems included chronic liver disease of uncertain etiology , for which he had been advised not to drink any alcohol .\\nHe also had a penetrating injury to the right eye , which had rendered him blind 10 years previously .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nHe was a chronically ill appearing elderly man , with a respiratory rate of 30 , temperature 99.6 , pulse 100 , and irregularly irregular , blood pressure 148/71 .\\nHe had some petechiae on his extremities , as well as in his mucosal membranes with some hemorrhagic bullae .\\nThere were bibasilar rales with some wheezing .\\nHe had no cardiac murmur .\\nHis abdomen was distended with massive hepatosplenomegaly , which was somewhat tender .\\nThe neurological examination aside from the blind right eye was unremarkable .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nIncluded a white blood count of 140,000 , 7% polys , 1% bands , 3% lymphs , 1% monos , 2 basos , 4 blasts , 76% pearl monocytes , 6% meta 's , 3 nucleated red blood cells .\\nThere were some oval tear drop cells and target cells with a few schistocytes .\\nThe platelet count was 9,000 , hematocrit was 26.5 , with an mean corpuscular volume of about 73 .\\nHis prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal .\\nHis uric acid was up at 97 , his total bilirubin was up at 1.8 , his LDH was 428 , his phosphorus was 1.2 , calcium 8.6 , Digoxin level was 1.0 , potassium on admission was 2.9 , sodium 135 , BUN and creatinine 13/1.6 , and sugar of 267 .\\nA computerized tomography scan of his head showed no signs of an acute bleed , a chest X-ray showed no new infiltrates or masses .\\nThere was cardiomegaly with prominent vascularity , but no effusions .\\nAn electrocardiogram was consistent with atrial fibrillation .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high dose Hydroxyurea , with a gradual improvement in his white blood count over the next few days .\\nHe did spike a fever and began Ancef and Gentamicin , although cultures never revealed a source for this .\\nHe also tried Amicar and continued on low dose Prednisone .\\nHis headache improved , but her remained profoundly weak and intermittently febrile with dyspnea .\\nThere was hemoptysis and intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding , while he remained profoundly thrombocytopenia .\\nTransfusions of platelets did not change his platelet count , presumably because of sequestration and a massive spleen .\\nAmicar was of uncertain value , but used intermittently .\\nA bone marrow biopsy revealed the transformation of his CMML to acute myelogenous leukemia , and given his other underlying medical problems , we chose chemotherapy with subcutaneous Cystosine Arabinoside and 6-Thioguanine , which he tolerated without incident and this brought his white blood count down to below 1,000 , and his spleen shrank noticeably , but he still could not maintain a bump in platelet count with platelet transfusions .\\nHe was intermittently congested limiting our ability to give intravenous fluid , for his hydrea , although we kept him on Allopurinol .\\nThe renal function deteriorated somewhat , hampering our ability to give him his Gentamicin .\\nThe family maintained an extraordinary vigil over the days of his hospitalization , providing him with some food and constant attention , while we awaited the results of his chemotherapy and treatment of his infection .\\nHe was intermittently restless and somewhat confused , and as his respiratory status deteriorated , the family agreed to a low dose Morphine drip which made him much more comfortable .\\nThey agreed with a do not resuscitate status early on in the hospitalization and in the course of being maintain on low dose Morphine , he ultimately expired on 2/28/94 with the family present .\\nNo autopsy was obtained .\\nLENNI BREUTZOLN , M.D.\\nTR :\\nlj / bmot\\nDD :\\n3/12/94\\nTD :\\n03/13/94\\nCC :\\nDr. Ca Shuff , FIH Oregon Dr. Ille Kote\\n[ report_end ]\\n</TEXT>\", \"<TEXT>\\n091433468

no obstruction of free air .\\nPhleboliths were identified .\\nPelvic ultrasound showed no hydronephrosis , 3 x 3 x 4 cm mass contiguous with posterior uterus , most consistent with a fibroid .\\nThe ovaries were not seen on the abdominal ultrasound .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nCardiac :\\nThe patient had no prior history of cardiac disease .\\nAlthough the chest pain that she had could have represented ischemia , there was a low clinical suspicion for this .\\nIt was most likely felt that the patient 's chest pain was reflective of her abdominal gastroenteritis .\\nHowever , she was admitted to a cardiac floor and put on telemetry and a myocardial infarction was ruled out by serial CK 's .\\nThe patient 's CK's were 233 , 198 and 132 .\\nElectrophoresis of the A set revealed no MB's .\\nThe patient 's EKG did not evolve .\\nThe patient has a long history of hypertension which has not been treated .\\nDuring this admission , she was started on nifedipine for control of her blood pressure .\\nGI :\\nThe patient presented with diffuse abdominal pain which was more pronounced in the left lower quadrant , nausea and vomiting .\\nThe differential diagnosis for this was felt to be a viral gastroenteritis , diverticulitis , degenerating fibroid , ovarian torsion and pelvic inflammatory disease .\\nAlthough the patient had cervical motion tenderness on admission physical exam , the gynecology service felt that the pelvic inflammatory disease was an unlikely diagnosis in this setting because the patient has had a tubal ligation in the past .\\nThe patient had an abdominal and pelvic CT scan at which time the ovaries were identified and were felt to be unremarkable .\\nAdditionally , the uterus itself was felt to be normal .\\nNo diverticula were seen on the CT scan and no abscess was seen .\\nAfter receiving 24 hours of IV fluids and hydration , the patient 's abdominal symptoms spontaneously resolved .\\nShe was taking po 's very well and had no further episodes of nausea , vomiting or emesis .\\nAt the time of discharge , she still had mild left lower quadrant pain on deep palpation only .\\nInfectious disease :\\nAt the time of admisison , the patient was afebrile and did not have a leukocytosis .\\nHowever , blood cultures were drawn on admission .\\nThe patient had a total of four sets of blood cultures drawn .\\nOne set of blood cultures grew out Group B strep and staph epi .\\nAs the patient was afebrile and had a normal white blood cell count , it was suspected that these cultures results were most likely a contaminant .\\nTwo additional sets of blood cultures were drawn and the patient was empirically started on vancomycin and Flagyl .\\nAfter 48 hours , all other blood cultures remained negative and the patient continued to be afebrile .\\nThe antibiotics were discontinued , she was observed and remained afebrile .\\nGynecologic :\\nThe patient had perimenopausal symptoms at the time of admission with hot flashes and irregular menstrual cycles .\\nA FSH level was drawn and is pending at the time of dictation .\\nThe gynecology service would like to have follow-up with the patient for routine gynecologic exam , pap smear and estrogen replacement counseling in approximately three months .\\nSocial :\\nWhile in house , the patient was seen by social services .\\nApparently , the patient lives alone and is without employment .\\nShe has no medical insurance .\\nIt was discussed that the patient should see the social service in outpatient Kingsec Li Hospital .\\nExercise treadmill :\\nPrior to discharge , the patient underwent ETT .\\nShe exercised for three minutes and 40 seconds on the standard Bruce protocol and achieved a peak heart rate of 138 and a peak blood pressure of 145/100 .\\nThis test was stopped because of leg and back pain .\\nImpression was that the study showed no evidence of ischemia .\\nHistory of syphilis :\\nThe patient was treated for syphilis in the 1970's .\\nRPR during this admission was reactive .\\nThe RPR titer itself was pending at the time of dictation .\\nBecause of the positive RPR titer , FTA was automatically sent off .\\nHowever , the usefulness of the FTA is questionable .\\nThe patient should have a follow-up of her RPR titer .\\nDISPOSITION :\\nMEDICATIONS :\\nOn discharge included Procardia XL , 90 mg po q a.m .\\nThe patient was discharged home in stable condition .\\nThe patient will have follow-up in the Kingsec Li Hospital with Dr. Boop on 12/10/92 .\\nKV968/1032 AYAN NO , M.D. XA4\\nD :\\n11/28/92\\nBatch :\\n4212\\nReport :\\nZ1010S54\\nT

chronic venous changes on his lower extremities .\\nHis pulses were 2+ .\\nThere was no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\\nNEURO :\\nNonfocal .\\nRECTAL :\\nGuaiac negative , good anal tone .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nSodium 128 , potassium 4.6 , chloride 87 , bicarb 24 , BUN 27 , creatinine 1.1 , and glucose 105 .\\nIn addition , his LDH was elevated to 323 .\\nHis ALT was 33 , his AST was 50 .\\nAlkaline phosphatase of 81 .\\nBilirubin of 0.8 .\\nHis white count was 14.9 , hematocrit 41.7 , platelet count of 487 .\\nHis coagulation profile was within normal limits .\\nChest x-ray revealed a small right lower lobe infiltrate , on the 14th , with a tiny effusion on the 20th , the night of admission .\\nThe pneumonia was now noted to be much larger , with a new right middle lobe infiltrate , as well as with a diffuse reticular interstitial pattern noted at the fringes of the pneumonic infiltrate .\\nSputums were sent off for gram stain and culture , as well as for AFB smear cultures .\\nHis electrocardiogram was within normal limits .\\nHis urine sediment was basically within normal limits .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nMr. Cliffestreukote was admitted on the night of the 20th , for obvious right lung pneumonia .\\nThe differential diagnosis included several organisms as outlined below .\\n(1) Pneumonia .\\nHe was admitted for a pneumonia unresponsive to antibiotics for five days .\\nThe pneumonia was found to be multilobar , and accompanied by significant hypoxia .\\nHe was started on broad spectrum coverage , including ceftriaxone , Clindamycin , and Ciprofloxacin .\\nThe ration off for the utilization of the Ciprofloxacin , was that because of his allergy to Erythromycin , an alternative regimen was needed to cover for Legionella , which was probably the leading diagnosis at the time of admission , because of his hyponatremia accompanied by liver function abnormalities .\\nHowever , he was isolated , and three AFB smears were obtained , in order to rule out tuberculosis .\\nIn addition , sputum induction was performed for Pneumocystis , which was negative .\\nHis urinary Legionella antigen subsequently came back negative .\\nHowever , this test is only 85-95% sensitive for Legionella pneumophila , type I , which is the subtype that causes some 80% of legionnaires disease .\\nHowever , the Legionella antigen is neither sensitive , nor specific , for other Legionella species that may be involved in Legionella pneumonia .\\nTherefore , the Ciprofloxacin was continued .\\nIn addition , his sputum cultures were all negative , as of the day of admission .\\nAfter admission , with the initiation of antibiotic therapy , Mr. Cliffestreukote remained quite hypoxic .\\nHowever , within one to two days after admission , he defervesced with a significant decrease in his cough during the week , post admission .\\nBecause of persistent hypoxemia on room air , as well as nasal cannula , some concern was raised about the possibility of underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , versus some other lesion that may predispose him for persistent hypoxemia , ( i.e. malignancy ) .\\nTherefore , an evaluation by the Pulmonary Team of the Tonwe Hospital , as well as a sputum cytology and chest CT scan , were all obtained .\\nThe chest CT scan revealed evidence for emphysematous changes of his lungs , as well as the previously noted right pneumonia , with several pseudo abscesses noted in infected bullae .\\nHis sputum cytology is pending at the time of discharge .\\nThe Pulmonary Team felt that the patient exhibited significant physical findings , laboratory values , and radiologic features , all consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .\\nTherefore , his persistent hypoxemia may be secondary to that underlying disease .\\nDespite being afebrile , with significant decrease in his cough , Mr. Cliffestreukote will be maintained , after discharge , on eleven more days of antibiotic therapy , to complete a full course .\\nIt should be noted , that Clindamycin was discontinued , approximately three days after admission , because of the development of diarrhea .\\nAdditionally , when switched to oral medication , Mr. Cliffestreukote was switched to Augmentin 500 mg. p.o. t.i.d. , as well as continuing on his Ciprofloxacin 150 mg. p.o. b.i.d.\\n(2) Hypertension .\\nWhile in the hospital , Mr. Cliffestreukote was maintained on hydrochlorothiazide , and Verapamil SR , and required no additional medication .\\n(3) Hyponatremia .\\nWhile in the hospital , persistent type of natremia was noted on the patient 's Profile 7 labs .\\nIt was felt that this was due largely to his pulmonary disease , and would resolve with the resolution of his intrapneumonic process .\\nWhile in the hospital , there were no complications .\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\\nAugmentin 500 mg. p.o. t.i.d. for eleven more days , Ciprofloxacin 750 mg. p.o. b.i.d. for eleven days , hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. p.o. q. day , Verapamil SR 240 mg. p.o. q. day , and Atrovent meter dose inhaler two puffs four times a day .\\nDISPOSITION :\\nHis condition on discharge was stable .\\nHe was discharged to home .\\nHe has a followup appointment with Dr. Naaan Jesc , in the Tonwe Hospital Pulmonary Clinic on 2-18-95 , at 9:45 A.M. , as well as with his primary care physician , Dr. Rybam Selcjescpint .\\nHis estimated disability is mild .\\nWe are still awaiting the results of his HIV testing .\\nDictated By :\\nNASA LINKEWEERTSJESCLEASK , M.D. CO23\\nAttending :\\nRYBAM T.

:\\nOrthostatic hypotension .\\nOTHER PROBLEMS :\\nHyponatremia .\\nHypokalemia .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient is a 66 year old white female without a significant past medical history who presented in the Middso Memorial Hospital Emergency Room following a nine day history of dizziness on standing without loss of consciousness .\\nDuring the week prior to admission , the patient complained of severe constipation , dry mouth , possible urinary retention along with some nausea and vomiting .\\nShe felt that she was profoundly cold at the time .\\nIn the emergency room , the patient was hypotensive with an initial blood pressure of 92/70 and a pulse of 96 lying flat that became 70/50 with a pulse of 104 when standing .\\nThe patient was aggressively hydrated with a total of 9 liters of normal saline over a 7 hour period with marginal increase in blood pressure .\\nOver the same period of time , the patient became increasingly hypoxic and developed worsening hypertension .\\nStat chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema .\\nThe patient was subsequently transferred to the MICU on Dopamine for further management .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nOnly noticeable for remote appendectomy and being gravida V , para V .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nNone .\\nALLERGIES :\\nNo known drug allergies .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nThe patient has an 80-pack-year history of tobacco and is currently smoking 1-2 packs per day .\\nShe also has a questionable alcohol history of up to one quart daily .\\nShe is married and lives with her husband .\\nFAMILY HISTORY :\\nNotable for coronary artery disease in both parents without a history of cancer or autoimmune disease , diabetes , thyroid disease .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nThe patient was an agitated elderly white female .\\nTemperature 97.8 , blood pressure 112/58 on Dopamine , pulse 134 , respirations 28 , oxygen saturation 93% on 100% nonrebreather .\\nHEENT :\\nShowed pupils equal , round and reactive to light .\\nExtraocular muscles intact .\\nOropharynx benign .\\nEyebrows were notable for lateral thinning .\\nNeck was supple without lymphadenopathy .\\nCarotids were 2+ .\\nNo palpable thyroid .\\nLungs showed decreased breath sounds bilaterally .\\nCardiac exam revealed S1 , S2 with an intermittent S4 without murmur or rubs .\\nAbdominal exam was benign .\\nExtremities showed mild clubbing , no cyanosis and no edema .\\nNeurologic exam :\\nThe patient was alert , agitated and oriented to name , date and place moving all extremities .\\nLight touch was intact .\\nADMISSION LABS :\\nSodium 127 , potassium 2.6 , chloride 76 , bicarb 35 , BUN 13 , creatinine 0.9 , glucose 105 , serum osmolality 254 , hematocrit 43.5 , white count 10.0 with 68% polys , 20% lymphs and 10 monos .\\nPlatelets 310 .\\nPT and PTT were normal .\\nLFT 's were within normal limits .\\nAdmission cortisol , aldosterone , B12 and folate and TSH were drawn .\\nChest x-ray on transfer to the MICU showed pulmonary vascular redistribution without infiltrate , effusions or nodules as compared with an admission chest x-ray which was interpreted as clear .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nIn the MICU , the patient initially required Dopamine for five days , at which point , she tolerated a wean without recurrent light headedness , dizziness or syncope .\\nEchocardiogram revealed preserved ejection fraction without regional wall motion abnormalities .\\nThe patient had a Swan-Ganz catheter placed which showed a cardiac output of 8 with systemic vascular resistance of 700 .\\nBecause the Swan-Ganz readings were felt to be explained by sepsis , the patient was treated empirically with Cefotaxime , Gentamicin and Flagyl .\\nAll cultures were subsequently negative with the exception of an E coli UTI .\\nThe infectious workup included a lumbar puncture which was negative for pleocytosis but showed an elevated glucose of 106 and an elevated protein of 76 .\\nThe patient had an extensive workup for hypopituitarism .\\nBecause Addisonian crisis could not be initially ruled out , the patient was placed on distressed dose Cortisone .\\nHowever , a random cortisol level drawn initially in the emergency room subsequently returned as normal .\\nThe patient also responded appropriately to Cortrosyn stimulation test .\\nAlso , TSH was normal on admission .\\nThyroid function panel drawn while the patient was on Dopamine was subsequently abnormal .\\nHowever , repeat panel was drawn when the patient was stable and had been transferred to the floor and was pending at the time of discharge .\\nThe patient was also evaluated by the neurology service for possible dysautonomia as the cause of her orthostatic hypotension with an inappropriate heart rate response to hypotension .\\nEMG showed no evidence of peripheral neuropathy .\\nAdditional studies also included a head CT that showed a small Lacunar infarct in the right pons and a partial empty sella which was confirmed by head MRI .\\nOther studies sent during the workup included a negative serum and urine protein electrophoresis , negative serum and urine immunoglobulin electrophoresis .\\nLH and SSH levels were consistent with a post-menopausal state .\\nGalactin levels were within normal limits .\\nANA was negative .\\nAce level was negative .\\nHeavy metal screen was negative except for a slightly elevated cobalt level so a possibility of a perineoplastic syndrome was considered .\\nAn anti-YO RI and WHO antibodies were sent and were pending at the time of discharge .\\nOn hospital day eight , the patient had uneventfully weaned off Dopamine and was transferred to the floor .\\nAt that time , the stress dose Hydrocortisone was weaned and the patient was switched to Prednisone without any evidence of recurrent hypotension .\\nHer initial hyponatremia and hypokalemia resolved with stable sodium and potassium levels prior to discharge .\\nIn the studying of aggressive fluid resuscitation , it was felt that the patient had been sent into pulmonary edema .\\nThe patient auto-diuresed spontaneously .\\nSubsequent to the diuresis , reticulonodular diffuse pattern became apparent on chest x-ray .\\nBecause of the patient 's significant smoking history , chest PT was performed to evaluate the possibility of lymphangitic carcinomatosis .\\nHowever , the chest CT showed relative sparing of the lower lobes with primary involvement in both upper lobes .\\nThe patient following diuresis had no oxygen requirement whatsoever and had no respiratory complaints .\\nPrior to discharge , she was evaluated by the pulmonary service who felt that the differential diagnosis for her chest CT included eosinophilic granuloma , idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , less likely sarcoidosis .\\nBecause the patient had no respiratory symptoms , it was felt that her abnormal chest CT would be best evaluated as an out-patient .\\nA new baseline chest x-ray was obtained prior to discharge .\\nShe will also require baseline pulmonary function tests as an out-patient .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nPrednisone taper 40 mg p.o. q day times two days , 30 mg p.o. q day times two days , 20 mg p.o. q day times three days , 10 mg p.o. q day times three days , 5 mg p.o. q day times three days .\\nMulti-vitamin one p.o. q day .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable .\\nDISPOSITION :\\nThe patient will be discharged to home .\\nShe will follow-up with Jacrendonate Sella , M.D. on 8/6/95 .\\nShe will need a pulmonary referral and pulmonary function tests as an out-patient .\\nAt the time of discharge ,

increasing chest pain and shortness of breath .\\nHe has a long history of coronary artery disease and has a two prior coronary bypass surgeries .\\nHis first coronary bypass surgery was on 5/7/1985 by Dr. Riez .\\nHe had LIMA to the LAD and vein graft to the diagonal and then a snake fashion two circumflexes and to the acute marginal branch of the right coronary artery .\\nHe presented with angina and had an occluded LAD and severe circumflex and right coronary disease .\\nHe had normal left ventricular function .\\nHe did well , but had recurrent angina by 1999 and cardiac catheterization in March of 2000 showed normal left ventricular function with a native nondominant right coronary artery having a 95% stenosis and the vein graft to this vessel was occluded .\\nThe left main was normal .\\nThe LAD was also occluded .\\nThe circumflex was patent , although there was disease of the obtuse marginal branches .\\nThe LIMA to the LAD was patent , but there was downstream 70% lesions at the apical portion of the LAD .\\nThe snake graft was open to the diagonal and to the first obtuse marginal branch , but was occluded to the second portion of this vessel .\\nFor this reason , he had a second bypass operation on 5/5/2000 by Dr. Riez .\\nHe had a vein graft to the acute marginal of the right coronary artery in snake fashion to the terminal portion of the right coronary artery .\\nHe had a vein graft to the diagonal and obtuse marginal one and a vein graft on the LAD bypassing the mid lesion .\\nThe LIMA was left from the first surgery .\\nHe did have transient atrial fibrillation after surgery .\\nHe had chest pain and an abnormal stress test in 2001 and cardiac catheterization at that time on 8/28/2001 showed that all the grafts were patent , but the runoff to the first diagonal for the vein graft was compromised and he had a 2.5 x 15 mm S660 stent placed at the ostium of the diagonal branch .\\nHe did have recurrent episodes of pain and his last stress test on 1/17/2005 showed that he could exercise for 9 minutes and then reached a peak heart rate of 99 on medication and a blood pressure of 150/100 , but he had shortness of breath and a posterolateral defect with some filling .\\nHe therefore was referred for cardiac catheterization .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nHis past medical history includes hypertension , elevated cholesterol , and a herniated disc .\\nHe also has had cataract repairs .\\nFAMILY HISTORY :\\nHe has a strong family history with a father and an uncle having had coronary disease at a young age .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nHis social history is that he lives in Lotyvall 1 , Quera , Minnesota with his wife Second .\\nHe has four children .\\nHe is present in a Capefrecam Luhthousy .\\nHe does not drink and does not smoke .\\nALLERGIES :\\nHe is allergic to contrast dye having had hypotension and is premedicated with steroids .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn exam , he is 5 feet , 9 inches , and 160 pounds .\\nHis blood pressure is 130/75 .\\nHis pulse is 50 and regular .\\nHis neck veins are not distended .\\nHis head and neck exam is normal .\\nHis lungs are clear .\\nHis cardiac exam shows no murmurs or gallops .\\nHis abdomen is benign .\\nHis peripheral pulses are intact .\\nHis neurologic exam was nonfocal .\\nHe is fully oriented .\\nLABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION :\\nIncludes an electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm with right bundle-branch block .\\nHematocrit 43% , potassium 4.3 , and creatinine of 1.0 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to the cardiac cath laboratory .\\nThere , the native right coronary artery was occluded and the vein graft to the RV marginal and the right-sided PDA was patent .\\nThe LAD was occluded and the LIMA to the proximal LAD was patent , but there was also a jump graft that went from the mid to the distal segment of the LAD and that was also patent .\\nThe vein graft to the diagonal and circumflex was also patent and the ostial diagonal stent was also patent .\\nThe culprit territory was the distal left-sided PDA coming off the circumflex and this had an 85% stenosis .\\nThis was a very small vessel and this was a tortuous segment and a long lesion .\\nIt was felt that this single lesion given the open distal right territory was not worth stenting and it was felt that he should be managed medically .\\nLeft ventriculography showed inferior hypokinesis and anterolateral hypokinesis with preserved left ventricular function .\\nHe tolerated the procedure well .\\nHe was monitored for the day .\\nHe ambulated without difficulty .\\nHe was discharged home and will be followed closely by his physicians at Sko Gerb Timp Valley Health and at Middso Memorial Hospital 's .\\nHe will remain on beta blockers , ACE inhibitors , statins , aspirin and Plavix indefinitely .\\nElectronically Signed IARD TIBELLEDIE FAT , M.D. 02/08/2005 18:08\\n_____________________________ IARD TIBELLEDIE FAT ,

on discharge was 2.5 .\\nC :\\nValves :\\nPatient had , as noted above , his anticoagulation was initially reversed despite his having artificial valves .\\nHowever , his Coumadin was subsequently restarted and he achieved therapeutic INR levels before discharge .\\nD :\\nPump :\\nPatient , during this hospital course , became hypervolemic likely due to his diuretics being held and due to his receiving blood products .\\nHe was diuresed initially with one dose of Lasix and subsequently with one dose of torsemide after it was discovered that he developed thrombocytopenia on a prior admission in reaction to Lasix .\\nHe subsequently was diuresed to a euvolemic state .\\nOf note , he did not become thrombocytopenic on this admission .\\nDISPOSITION :\\nWas discharged on 11/16/2003

no chest pain , no shortness of breath , no upper respiratory symptoms , no cough , no dysuria , and no abdominal pain .\\nOf note , blood cultures from Christmas Eve grew MSSA in the blood .\\nIn the emergency room , she was given 6 units subcu , with no resolve , then insulin drip at 6 units per hour , then increased to 10 including with IV hydration , and she was started on nafcillin for MSSA .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nCirrhosis , hep C , diabetes , rheumatoid arthritis , hypertension , neuropathy , right arm fracture , status post fall , CAD , with a stress echo 12/1 which showed reversible ischemia and an EF of 60% .\\nHer medications on admission included Lasix 80 , Norvasc 2.5 , Lopressor 50 b.i.d. , lisinopril 40 q. day , Risperdal one q. day , Humulin 70/30 40 U in the morning and 25 U in the evening , regular insulin scale , carbamazepine 100 , and Neurontin .\\nShe has no known drug allergies .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nThe patient lives alone .\\nShe walks with a cane , has LRAH care , no tobacco , no alcohol , no drug use .\\nPHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION :\\nShe was afebrile at 97.6 , heart rate 102 , respirations 20 , blood pressure 192/92 .\\nIn general , she was an obese African American woman in no acute distress , mumbling .\\nHEENT :\\nPupils equal and reactive , her oropharynx was moist with no lesions .\\nCardiovascularly , she was tachycardic , normal S1 and S2 , regular , no murmurs .\\nJVP was flat .\\nHer lungs were clear to auscultation .\\nAbdomen was obese , soft , non-tender , no masses , no rebound , and no guarding .\\nEXTREMITIES :\\nShe had swelling in the right arm , very , very minimal .\\nHer right arm was on a sling .\\nIn her lower extremities , she had bilateral edema to the knees , 2+.\\nNEURO :\\nShe was oriented to person only , intermittently following commands .\\nLabs were notable for blood cultures positive for MSSA .\\nChest x-ray was pending at the time of admission .\\nHead CT was negative .\\nEKG showed normal sinus , no ST changes .\\nHer labs were notable on admission for a sodium of 129 , creatinine of 2.0 , hematocrit of 34 , albumin was 2.5 .\\nShe had a gap of 14 .\\nHer ABG was 7.40 , 47 , 90 .\\nHer CKs and troponins were negative .\\nHer beta hydroxybutyrate was 0.36 .\\nHer UA showed 3+ protein , 5-8 WBCs , 8-10 RBCs , and 1+ bacteria .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM :\\nThis is a 55-year-old with a history of uncontrolled diabetes in the past , who presents with HHNK .\\nAt the time , she was treated for such , including IV fluids and an insulin drip .\\nShe recovered very nicely .\\nContinued hospital course , she recovered well from her HHNK .\\nOrtho-wise , emergent ortho consult decided that the right shoulder needed to be drained .\\nTap showed that she had an active infection , with 464000 WBCs , 198000 RBCs , including 88% polys , from the right shoulder .\\nTherefore , she was thought to have right shoulder sepsis and was taken to the OR emergently .\\nIn the operating room , 40-50 cc of pus was drained from the shoulder and a drain was placed .\\nShe received IV fluids and had an estimated blood loss of 1200 cc .\\nThe patient 's crit dropped from a baseline of 32 to 19 .\\nShe was also not following commands and her glucose was 876 .\\nShe was then transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit .\\nIn the Medical Intensive Care Unit on 12/30/02 , the patient was recovering , with being able to follow commands .\\nShe stayed in the Intensive Care Unit until 1/5/03 .\\nShe was treated with nafcillin and gentamicin , also with vancomycin .\\nCultures still showed MSSA .\\nHospital course during the MICU stay was notable for a decreased hematocrit .\\nShe received multiple units of blood for this .\\nAlso , she had decreased urine output , thought to be prerenal , and received large volume IV fluids .\\nShe required small doses , a renal dose of dopa , to increase her urine output , and she did better .\\nShe responded well and then the dopa was D / c'd on 1/4/03 .\\nFrom the ID perspective , the patient had a TTE on 12/30 that showed an EF of 65% , question of a mobile echodensity along the RV , but no proof of endocarditis .\\nThis was significant in that the head CT done on 1/4/03 to evaluate change in mental status revealed a new right parietal infarct that may represent septic emboli ; however , on further evaluation it was thought that this was most likely a stroke , not really just sepsis .\\nThere was no recommendation for further workup .\\nShe was transferred to the floor on 1/5/03 , and by system :\\n1. ID :\\nShe was continued to be treated for MSSA bacteremia and she should complete a 6 weeks course .\\n2. RENAL :\\nPatient slowly improved with her creatinine on the day of admission , still continuing to improve .\\nSecondary to all the IV fluids she received in the Intensive Care Unit , the patient has been having a goal of -1 L / day , which we have been able to accomplish successfully on Lasix 120 mg p.o. b.i.d. , with extra doses of 80 mg IV as needed .\\n3. Cardiovascularly , patient , of note , had an EKG that had intermittent right bundle-branch block ; however , this recovered .\\nShe does have known CAD from previous echos .\\nShe has been stable .\\nShe is on a beta blocker .\\nHer ACE inhibitor had been held , but may be restarted as soon as her creatinine normalizes .\\n4. NEUROLOGICAL :\\nHer head CT showed a right parietal infarct .\\nPatient should have an MRI as an outpatient to follow up .\\nMost likely represents an ischemic stroke .\\nWorkup for B12 and RPR studies were all negative .\\n5.

Heme-wise , her hematocrit remained stable .\\n7. Endocrine-wise , her sugars have been much improved and she continues on her NPH dose .\\nPlan for the long term is that the patient will receive six weeks of IV antibiotics .\\nShe will return to see Dr. Ayan Koteskismanhout in orthopaedic surgery in 10-12 weeks for evaluation of the right shoulder and aspiration .\\nIf the aspirate is negative and overall health is good , then she will consider implantation of hemiarthroscopy ; for now , she needs to continue in the sling .\\nFor access , the patient will have a PICC line in order to continue IV fluids .\\nThe discharge medications include albuterol nebulizer 2.5 q. 2 h. as needed , calcium carbonate 1250 b.i.d. , carbamazepine 100 p.o. t.i.d. , Lasix 120 p.o. q. day , insulin sliding scale , lactulose 15-30 mL p.o. q.i.d. as needed

Cardiovascular :\\nThe patient ruled out for MI by cardiac markers .\\nThe patient was set to go for a dobutamine stress test on 11/16/04 given her history of COPD , but the stress portion was canceled when she was down there due to fever and hypotension .\\nThe next day , she underwent a cardiac echo ( transthoracic echocardiogram ) .\\nThis echo showed LV ejection fraction of 50% with no wall motion abnormality .\\nHowever , the right ventricular was diffusely hypokinetic .\\nIt was suboptimally imaged , so there was no RVSP given .\\nThe patient also suffered a hypotensive episode while in the endoscopy suite for her EGD on 11/17/04 .\\nThis responded to fluid bolus .\\nThe patient was then transferred to Medicine Team D given her tenuous hemodynamic status .\\nThe patient , several days later 11/23 , underwent another dobutamine stress test .\\nThis stress test , although complicated by hypotension again , to the 60 's or 70 's was completed and there was some mild anterior septal thinning , but no evidence of ischemia and an EF from this test was 76% .\\nClearly , the patient 's hemodynamic vascular status was very sensitive to dobutamine .\\n2. Infectious Disease :\\nOn hospital day #2 , the patient was noted to have increased dyspnea on exertion .\\nThe next day she developed a fever and she was started on levofloxacin for a potential UTI .\\nShe continued to have low-grade fevers and on the next day , 11/17/04 , her chest x-ray showed possible new right upper lobe infiltrates .\\nShe was then started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin .\\nHer urine legionella antigen was negative .\\nOn 11/22/04 , she was noted to have gram-positive cocci in her sputum .\\nShe was started on vancomycin for this .\\nThese bacteria turned out to be MRSA and she was continued on her vancomycin .\\nShe had PICC line placed on the day prior to discharge for home vancomycin administration .\\n3. GI :\\nThe patient had an episode of nausea on the morning of 11/16/04 associated with some cough , apparent emesis .\\nGI was consulted for an EGD , however , while she was in the Endoscopy Suite , as mentioned above , she had a hypotensive episode , which responded to some fluid boluses .\\nFinally , on the day prior to discharge , she was stabilized to the point that she could have her EGD .\\nThe EGD did show three esophageal ulcers that were localized and apparent suggestion of pill esophagitis .\\nHer stomach and duodenum were normal and it was suggested that she change her Nexium doses to daily and that she also drink plenty of fluids and water with meals , sit upright when she would eat her meals to decrease the chance of pills eroding her esophagus .\\n4. Shortness of breath :\\nAs mentioned above , the patient did develop MRSA pneumonia that was started to be treated with vancomycin and she did also develop an oxygen requirement the day prior to discharge .\\nAt most , her oxygen requirement was 4-5 liters and on the day prior to discharge , she was satting well on two liters of nasal cannula .\\nThis was thought to be due to her pneumonia ; however , with her right ventricular hypokinesis , it is also possible that she may have an element of pulmonary hypertension and may warrant further investigation as an outpatient , for example , with chest CT .\\n5. Derm :\\nSeveral days prior to discharge , the patient developed some erythematous rash under her left breast and left side that was thought to be due to yeast .\\nShe was started on some Miconazole Cream .\\nThe rash was always localized to her left side , sometimes extending down to her leg , but never on the right side .\\nThe rash appeared to be resolving by the time of discharge .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nTums , 500-1250 mg PO tid .\\nAlbuterol inhaler .\\nLipitor , 20 daily .\\nProzac , 60 daily .\\nFlovent inhaler , 220 mcg bid .\\nAtrovent , two puffs qid

SUMMARY NAME :\\nPREHEPRIOR , NIENEMILEISELE\\nUNIT NUMBER :\\n372-41-54\\nADMISSION DATE :\\n03/24/97\\nDISCHARGE DATE :\\n03/28/97\\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\\nGait disorder .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient is a 31-year-old right-handed female with right-sided greater than left-sided weakness and difficulty walking for several days .\\nShe was in her usual state of health until 3/20/97 when she experienced the fairly sudden onset of predominantly right-sided arm and leg weakness and ataxia .\\nShe was standing and walking with her friend , who \" had to catch her from falling down \" as she toppled towards the right .\\nShe evidently recovered from the episode after a number of minutes .\\nThe following day , she remained in bed through essentially all of the day due to malaise with no specific deficits being noted .\\nIn the subsequent two days , she had several small spells of \" imbalance \" , particularly towards the right , and other symptoms included diffuse and mainly frontal headaches and mild neck soreness .\\nThere was no diplopia , visual loss , speech abnormality or sensory change in her history .\\nShe was initially evaluated at an outside hospital emergency room , and then transferred to Well General Hospital .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nIs notable for depression , and she has been followed regularly by Dr. Freiermchird of Nash Health for several months with pharmacologic treatment , which is apparently working well .\\nHer Doxepin has recently been increased .\\nShe is status post appendectomy and otherwise has no remarkable past medical history .\\nALLERGIES :\\nQuinine gives her a rash .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nThe only medications she is on are Paxil 30 mg p.o. q.day , Doxepin 25 mg p.o. q.day , and Klonopin 2 mg p.o. q.h.s.\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nShe is currently unemployed , but until recently , she was employed at a bank .\\nShe was born and raised in Atonlaremont Rockpo .\\nThere is a history of childhood abuse .\\nShe does not drink .\\nShe is a former tobacco user and takes no illicit drugs .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nShe was pleasant , in no acute distress ; blood pressure 130/60 ; heart rate 66 ; respirations 18 ; temperature 98 .\\nHer thyroid was within normal limits .\\nThere were no carotid or cervical bruits .\\nShe had a normal S1 and S2 and regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs .\\nHer lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally .\\nHer abdomen was benign .\\nHer extremities were without clubbing , cyanosis , edema , or rash ; there were some older hematomas in the bilaterally shins .\\nMental status - her speech was fluent without errors .\\nHer affect was slightly inappropriate at times ; for example , singing or humming along while performing some of the motor tasks and giving the impression of indifference to the deficits that were demonstrated on the examination .\\nHer memory was fully intact for short-term recollection of three out of three objects at five minutes with excellent naming , repetition , proverb interpretation , and ability to follow commands .\\nVisual fields were full to confrontation .\\nHer left pupil was 7 mm reacting to 5 mm .\\nHer right pupil was 5.5 mm reacting to 4 mm .\\nHer extraocular movements were intact for horizontal and vertical pursuits .\\nThere was no nystagmus and no ptosis .\\nHer saccades were normal .\\nFacial strength and sensation were full and symmetric .\\nHer tongue , uvula and palate were midline .\\nShoulder shrug was 5/5 power .\\nMotor examination revealed 5/5 power in all groups in the proximal and distal upper and lower extremities .\\nThere was no drift .\\nThere was normal bulk and tone .\\nShe had slightly slow fine finger motility approximately equal bilaterally , although this was extremely difficult to reproduce .\\nSensory - intact light touch , temperature , and vibration overall .\\nReflexes were 2+ throughout in the upper and lower extremities , and toes were downgoing .\\nThere was no jaw jerk and no Hoffman \\'s sign .\\nCoordination - toe tap was slow bilaterally , although difficult to reproduce , and at best , was essentially within normal limits .\\nOn standing , she tended to fall to the front , back or sides without trying to stop her fall initially , and extensive gait testing was deferred due to concerns for safety .\\nHer heel-to-shin and finger-to-nose testing was fully intact bilaterally without ataxia or tremor .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nWere unremarkable with normal electrolytes and complete blood count parameters .\\nHer erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 12 .\\nHer coagulation parameters were normal .\\nHead CT scan without contrast showed normal brain parenchyma and no intracranial process .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\\nThe patient was admitted for her gait disorder with other notable findings on examination including anisocoria , which , by the patient \\'s report , had been noted several months earlier .\\nA magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiogram study was obtained , which showed no clear evidence of arterial dissections or infarction or other pathologic processes .\\nShe had been placed on heparin initially , but this was discontinued after the magnetic resonance imaging results were obtained .\\nPosterior transcranial Doppler studies showed normal studies of both vertebral arteries , and carotid non-invasive studies showed normal right and left carotid bifurcations .\\nOn the second hospital day , her gait continued to be markedly unstable , although with no consistent pattern in terms of weakness or directionality of falling , and she continued to have no reproducible upper extremity or lower extremity ataxia or dysmetria .\\nShe was seen by the Psychiatry Service .\\nShe was not felt to be acutely suicidal or otherwise in need of acute psychiatric treatment .\\nThe psychiatrist also noted the indifference the patient evinced regarding her own symptomatology .\\nThe patient was evaluated in one of the neurology conferences for several hours , and during this time , showed significant improvement while receiving gait training as well as evaluation ; in particular , she became more stable with counter-balancing methods .\\nThis trend of improvement continued , and she was discharged in stable condition .\\nShe will follow up with her psychiatrist , Dr. Freiermchird ( Sone Memorial Hospital ) on a regular basis , and she can follow up with the Neurology Service on a p.r.n. basis if needed .\\nShe will continue on her previous outpatient medical regimen .\\nNIREGE MEMORY , M.D.\\nTR :\\nbzo\\nDD :\\n03/29/97\\nTD :\\n03/31/97 12:36 P\\ncc :\\nNYRI A MEMORY , M.D.\\nASHELLRIETTE NESSASU THREATSVOT , M.D.\\nEJEAN NADARC

CK was 113 .\\nThyroid function tests were normal .\\nTroponin I was 0.05 .\\nTotal protein was 8 , albumin 4.3 , globulin 3.7 , calcium 9.9 , phosphate 2.7 , magnesium 2.0. White blood cell count was 7 , hemoglobin 14.1 , hematocrit 43.6 , platelet count 241 .\\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate was 41 .\\nPT was 12.3 , PTT 27.1. An EKG showed sinus bradycardia at 53 with a normal axis , first degree atrioventricular block , biphasic T-waves in V1 to V3 without any acute changes .\\nA chest x-ray shows left lower lobe consolidation .\\nThe head CT scan revealed a large right occipital infarct without midline shift , but positive mass effect on the temporal horn , on the right ventricle and some effacement of the sulci in the right parietal area .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to a telemetry bed and started on heparin .\\nAround 4:00 AM the next day , an acute decompensation in respiratory status was noted .\\nLung examination at that point showed good air entry , no wheezing , coarse breath sounds throughout .\\nNeurologically , the patient was not following commands .\\nEyes were closed .\\nHe was moving the right arm and leg spontaneously , though less than before .\\nWithdrawal to pain was still present .\\nBoth plantars were upgoing .\\nA blood gas at this point showed a pH of 7.49 , pO2 61 , pCO2 of 33 on 100% non-rebreather mask .\\nEKG showed sinus tachycardia .\\nThe patient 's temperature was 102 degrees .\\nA repeat CAT scan of the head was performed .\\nThis showed continued evolution of the right posterior cerebral artery infarction now extending into the right cerebellar hemisphere .\\nThere was also a high density adjacent to the right cerebellar infarction suggesting the presence of hemorrhage .\\nAt this point , the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit .\\nAn MRI and MRA of the head was arranged to evaluate the extent of his stroke and the posterior circulation .\\nThe MRI showed infarct of the cerebellar hemispheres bilaterally , the right occipital lobe , the right thalamus and bilateral pons .\\nThe MRA of the intracranial circulation demonstrated gross patency of the internal carotid arteries bilaterally and the basilar arteries .\\nThe left vertebral artery was not visualized .\\nThere was a dominant right vertebral artery .\\nThere was mildly reduced flow in the branches of the right middle cerebral artery compared to the left .\\nThere was visualization of flow within both posterior cerebral arteries .\\nClinically , the patient continued to deteriorate .\\nNeurosurgery was consulted , however the neurosurgeons felt that there was no surgical option , since even in the case of cerebellar swelling , there would be no improvement from decompensation .\\nThe patient was therefore treated conservatively with fluid restriction and blood pressure management .\\nHeparin was discontinued because of the risk of intercerebral hemorrhage .\\nThe aspiration pneumonia was treated with Cefotaxime and Metronidazole .\\nThe patient 's family was involved and they decided to opt for DNR / DNI in view of the poor prognosis .\\nThe patient passed away at 6:45 AM on June 12 , 1998 .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nDeceased .\\nDISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nNone .\\nDictated By :\\nGREGSIS STREETS , M.D. SQ51\\nAttending :\\nCHLINO B.
